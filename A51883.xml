            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Here offer you a Book written by a <hi>Turk,</hi> whoſe Matter is as inſtructive and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the Manner of finding it, was ſtrange and ſurprizing.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, but you would know where 'twas written; and perhaps, whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor be living; and whether you muſt expect a <hi>Romance,</hi> or a <hi>real Hiſtory.</hi> Hear then, in ſhort, what will fully ſatisfie you.</p>
            <p>The Curioſity of ſeeing <hi>Paris,</hi> made a Man of <hi>Letters,</hi> leave <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Year 1682; where being arrived, he found ſuch Diverſions, as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſtay longer than he intended.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he been Two Months in <hi>Paris,</hi> when, by changing his Lodging, he diſcovered by meer Chance, in a Corner of his Chamber, a great heap of Papers; which ſeem'd more ſpoil'd by Duſt, than Time.</p>
            <p>He was at firſt ſurprized to ſee nothing but barbarous Characters, and was upon the Point of leaving them without any further ſearch, if a <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence, which he perceived on the top of a Leaf, had not retained him:</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46436:4"/>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi amatur, non laboratur; &amp; ſi</l>
               <l>Laboratur, labor amatur.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Surprize of the <hi>Italian</hi> was yet greater, when after having conſidered theſe Characters with more Attention, he found them to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick;</hi> which Language was not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, which made him look narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier into them; where he found, That they treated of Affairs of State; that they contained Relations of War and Peace; and diſcourſed, not only of the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> but of thoſe of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> till the Year 1682.</p>
            <p>The curious <hi>Italian</hi> was in no ſmall Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to know how, and where theſe <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> had been writ, and by what Adventure they came to lie ſo neglected in a Corner of his Chamber. But before he further informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he thought it expedient to tranſport theſe Manuſcripts into another Houſe, as a Place of greater Security.</p>
            <p>He afterwards queſtioned his Landlord with great Precaution, concerning the Papers; and he inform'd him even to the leaſt Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>He told him, That a Stranger, who ſaid he was a Native of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> Habited like an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick,</hi> greatly Studious, of ſmall Stature, of a very courſe Countenance, but of ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Goodneſs of Life, had lived long at his Houſe. That he came to lodge there in the Year 1664, and had ſtaid Eighteen Years with him; that being gone abroad one day, he returned no
<pb facs="tcp:46436:4"/>more, and they had had no certain News of him ſince. He was about Seventy Years old, had left Manuſcripts that no Body underſtood, and ſome Moneys, which was an Argument, that his Departure was not premeditated.</p>
            <p>He added, That he had always a Lamp Day and Night burning in his Chamber; had but few Moveables, only ſome Books, a ſmall Tome of St. <hi>Auſtin, Tacitus,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> with the Picture of <hi>Maſſaniello,</hi> whom he praiſed very much, calling him the <hi>Moſes of Naples.</hi> He ſaid further, That this Strangers greateſt Friend, and whom he ſaw often, was a Man which moſt People took for a <hi>Saint,</hi> ſome for a <hi>Jew,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuſpected to be a <hi>Turk.</hi> According to the Landlord's Report, he came to <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year 1637, being then but Twenty Eight Years of Age. At firſt he had lodged with a <hi>Flemming;</hi> he went oft to Court, Moneys never failed him; he had Friends, and paſſed for very Learned. As for his End, this Man thinks he died miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; it being ſuſpected, that he had been thrown into the River.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> being ſufficiently inſtructed by what he had heard, applyed himſelf to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language; and as he had already ſome Knowledge in it, he quickly learnt enough to Tranſlate theſe Manuſcripts, which he undertook a while after; and he examined with care the Truth of what the <hi>Moldavian</hi> had writ; confronting the Events he met, with the Hiſtories of thoſe Times; and to ſucceed the better, ſearched the moſt approved <hi>Memorials,</hi> having had Acceſs into the Cabinets of Princes and their Miniſters.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46436:5"/>
            <p>Theſe Letters contain the moſt conſiderable Intrigues of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt remarkable Tranſactions of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which have been ſent to ſeveral Officers of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>By theſe may be known the Perſpicacity of this Agent of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and by him the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe that command in that Nation, who choſe (the better to penetrate into the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) a Man, who could not be ſuſpected by his Exterior; who was deform'd, but prudent and adviſed; and, for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing him, deſtined his ordinary Abode in one of the greateſt and moſt peopled Cities of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During his being at <hi>Paris,</hi> which was Forty Five Years, he has been Eye-witneſs of many great Changes; has ſeen the Death of two great Miniſters of State; has ſeen that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom involved in War, without and within. He was ſcarce ſetled in <hi>Paris,</hi> but he was witneſs to the Birth of a King, who ſurpaſſes thoſe that preceded him; in a time, when the Queen's Barrenneſs, cauſed the King, her Husband, to deſpair of ever having a Son that ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him.</p>
            <p>During the Courſe of ſo many Years, he hath ſeen Cities revolt, and return again to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of their Sovereign; Princes of the Blood, make War againſt their King; and Queen <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> Wife, Mother, and Mother-in-Law to ſome of the greateſt Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> die in Exile in <hi>Cologne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpeaks frankly of the Princes of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46436:5"/>and explains his Sentiments with Liberty. He ſaith, The <hi>Emperor</hi> commands Princes, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Men, and the King of <hi>France</hi> ſees Men and even Kings obey his Orders. He adds, That the Firſt commands and prays, the Second ſees oft times more effected than he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and that the Third commands many brave Souldiers, and is well nigh obeyed by Crowned Heads. There appears no Hate or Animoſity in him, in what he writes againſt the <hi>Pope.</hi> In Diſcourſing of the <hi>Emperor</hi> and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſays, That both of them having Provinces of ſuch vaſt Extent, they are not much concerned at the Loſſes they ſuſtain.</p>
            <p>He believed that <hi>England</hi> was more powerful than the <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> [<hi>he might have added</hi> France] at Sea. He apprehended more the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> than their Arms. He magnifies what paſſed in the Wars of <hi>Candy,</hi> which the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſupported with ſo much Bravery againſt the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> with him are perfect <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> He ſpeaks of the laſt Plague, and laſt War, that this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> hath been afflicted with; he touches ſomething of the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt this <hi>State</hi> by <hi>Raggi</hi> and <hi>Torne;</hi> and to ſhew, that he underſtood their Hiſtory; he ſays ſomewhat of <hi>Vachero</hi> and <hi>Balbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou wilt ſee, Reader, by the Progreſs of the Work, what this ſecret Envoy of the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> thought of the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>North:</hi> And I have drawn his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, becauſe thou maiſt underſtand better what I give thee of him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46436:6"/>
            <p>This <hi>Arabian</hi> (for he declares himſelf in his Writings, to have been of that Nation) having been taken and made a Slave by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> was brought into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Learning. He ſtudied <hi>Logick</hi> in his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and applyed himſelf much to <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> he overcame them by ſuffering with Patience the Blows of his Maſter, who often beat him for endeavouring to acquire thoſe Lights, which this Brute had not. And finally, after much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, great Aſſiduity and long Watchings, he came, as he writes himſelf, to underſtand <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; he had commerce after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the beſt Maſters; and during his ſojourning in the <hi>French</hi> Court, he joyned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to the Knowledge he had acquired.</p>
            <p>He explains himſelf neatly, and ſpeaks of Things with great Frankneſs. His Style ſhews a great liberty of Spirit, and never Paſſion; and if it appear that he accommodes himſelf to the Faſhion of the Court, one may ſee that it is not out of deſign to pleaſe, but that he wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf ſometimes to the <hi>Genius</hi>'s of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt find in his Letters <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> If ſometimes he appears tart, 'tis to ſhew his Vivacity, not diſoblige; and he appears all over fully inſtructed in <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. He is very reſerved when he blames, and ſeems perſwaded when he praiſes. When he ſpeaks to the great Men of the <hi>Port,</hi> his Style is very grave; and he changes when he writes to meaner Perſons. He never tells News that he is not aſſured of, nor thinks of divining Things that ſeem obſcure to him.</p>

            <p>He gives rare Leſſons when he writes of the Revolutions of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Portugal</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which happened in our Days; with ſtrange Circumſtances, terrible Murders, and the Death of a Potent King, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr'd by his own Subjects upon a Scaffold, before his own Door.</p>
            <p>He weighs much the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s hardy Reſolution of going to <hi>Naples,</hi> to ſuccour the Revolted there; and he reaſons not as a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian,</hi> but like an able States-man, and wiſe Philoſopher, on the Riſe and Ruin of States. He always diſcourſes with Liberty, and what he ſays, is filled with ſolid and agreeable Thoughts. He ſpeaks ſometimes of the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Tyranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> of the Violence of the Miniſters of the <hi>Port,</hi> and upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated Death which many of the <hi>Sultans, Baſha's,</hi> and <hi>Vizirs</hi> are forced to ſuffer. But, this Language is only to his Friends and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents.</p>
            <p>However, though theſe Letters be neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> nor written by a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> they contain nothing of Barbarous; and though the Ignorant be in great Numbers amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> there are yet Men of great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that write the <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, though they are not eaſily come by; for, their Books not being Printed, they ſcarce ever reach us. We may notwithſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That amongſt this Nation, that we term Barbarous, there are great and wiſe Captains, good Men, and learned Authors; as we have amongſt us <hi>Generals</hi> without Conduct, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
<pb facs="tcp:46436:7"/>
               <hi>Votaries,</hi> and ignorant Fellows that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Maſters.</p>
            <p>To juſtifie what I affirm of the <hi>Turks,</hi> let us but conſider their Victories, which have gained them ſo many Kingdoms, their Power at Sea, their Exactneſs to puniſh Crimes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Merit. As for Printing, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure it amongſt them. A <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>'s judgment of it was remarkable, which ſhews rather their Prudence than any effect of their Ignorance. A famous Printer of <hi>Holland,</hi> by Religion a <hi>Jew,</hi> came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> bringing Preſſes with him, with Characters of all Sorts of <hi>Idioms,</hi> particularly <hi>Arabick, Turk, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Letters, with deſign to introduce the uſe of Printing into that great City. As ſoon as the <hi>Vizir</hi> was informed of it, he cauſed the <hi>Jew</hi> to be Hanged, and broke all his Engins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Millions of Characters which he had brought; declaring, it would be a great Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that One Man ſhould, to enrich himſelf, take the Bread out of the Mouths of Eleven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Scribes, who gained their Livings at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> by their Pens.</p>
            <p>Peruſe, Gentle Reader, what I offer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of tiring thy ſelf, or being deceived. As <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors think of nothing ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of writing <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we have reaſon to believe not to find all the Truth in their Works. Intereſt and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do often make good Princes paſs for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and unjuſt and cruel Princes, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times transferred to Poſterity for Models of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Clemency. This occaſions Hiſtories
<pb facs="tcp:46436:7"/>which iſſue from ſo corrupt a Source, to ſerve like a pitch'd Field for <hi>Modern</hi> Writers, where the one and the other combat for the deſtruction of Truth; the one falſly reporting what they have heard; and the other, by as badly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the things they ſeem to witneſs. Moſt Princes will have their Altars, and then 'tis no wonder if there are Prieſts found to ſacrifice to Falſhood, and Idolaters, to deface the Statue of Truth.</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>General</hi> that will not always ſeem Conqueror, and Princes never confeſs their Loſſes, which occaſions a Confuſion, and the Actions of Men do thereby become doubtful.</p>
            <p>How many times have we ſeen both the Victors and Vanquiſhed make Bonfires for their Succeſſes? And, in our Days, we have known the <hi>French</hi> rejoyce, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> ſing their <hi>Te Deum</hi> for the ſame Thing.</p>
            <p>As we are, perhaps, now leſs juſt than in Ages paſt, it is difficult to write Things as they are, particularly during the Lives of Princes; whoſe Hiſtory cannot be writ without Fear, nar the Truth ſaid without Danger. For theſe <hi>Reaſons,</hi> we ought not to queſtion the Credit of our <hi>Arabian,</hi> who reports with Liberty what came to his Knowledge: Beſides, he being an univerſal Enemy to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and a conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, neither diſobliged or gained by any, and religiouſly true to his <hi>Prince,</hi> whom he adores as a <hi>Divinity;</hi> it cannot be imagined, that he ſays any thing for Fear or Favour.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46436:8"/>
            <p>As theſe Relations have been read with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and diligently examined, we may be aſſured of an exact Hiſtory, abounding in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Events; and this Hiſtory being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Letters, as the Author writ them, the Reader may read them without repining. If he will not acknowledge the <hi>Tranſlator</hi>'s Pains, let him at leaſt receive the Labours of a dead Man with Civility, one that never dreamt his <hi>Memorials</hi> would be Printed, and that ſerved his Maſter faithfully.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sentiments made him exactly follow that Sentence of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> found in the Front of his Works:</p>
            <q>Where Love is, there is no Labour; and if there be Labour, the Labour is loved.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Tranſlator</hi> hath thought fit to retrench ſome Ceremonies and proud Titles of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People. What is repreſented here, is in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Style, ſuch as the Ancient <hi>Latins</hi> uſed in their Writings to their <hi>Conſuls, Dictators</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> themſelves. And, if the Tranſlation be not Elegant as the <hi>Arabick,</hi> do not accuſe the Author, ſeeing it is not poſſible to reach the Force and Beauty of the Original.</p>
            <p>Have moreover ſome Reſpect for the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this <hi>Mahometan;</hi> for, living unknown, he was ſafe from the Inſults of the Great Ones, ſo that he might write Truth without Danger, which ordinarily is diſguiſed by Fear or Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, having ſtill reported the Tranſactions of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with no leſs Truth than Eloquence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46436:8"/>
            <p>If what I have ſaid cannot ſatisfie the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, expect the reſt of theſe Letters, which will be found full of great <hi>Actions,</hi> profitable <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> and good <hi>Morals.</hi> Thank God however, who raiſes Men that employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vanquiſhing Ignorance and Idleneſs, and in rendring Juſtice to <hi>Mahmut,</hi> a paſſionate <hi>Slave</hi> for the Intereſt of his <hi>Maſter</hi> and the Truth: Have ſome Goodneſs for the <hi>Tranſlator;</hi> who being born free, acknowledges no Maſter, but <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>I Had too good an Opinion of my ſelf, and did not ſufficiently conſider to whom I wrote, when I attempted, in ſo little a time, to give thee an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and how this King lives. An old <hi>Arabian</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>To have a perfect Knowledge of Things, we muſt know them more than Once, and forget them Thrice, to the end, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a Fourth time, they may become perfectly our own.</hi> This will inſtruct me how to write to my Friends hereafter; not as I underſtand Affairs, but as they ought to be underſtood: For, once well done, is better than twice ill done.</p>
                  <p>I think I may ſay, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> want Ground themſelves, by taking an handful from others. Two and twenty of their Galleys, with ſome other ſmall Veſſels, have taken two ſmall Iſlands named St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s and St. <hi>Honorat</hi>'s, which lie over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Provence,</hi> and are barren and unprofitable Places, and will ſerve to little purpoſe, unleſs for Ports; and 'tis alſo a queſtion, how long they will hold them.</p>
                  <p>The War betwixt theſe two Nations is like to continue, eſpecially from the death of the two <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46436:15"/>Princes, <hi>Victor Amade,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Charles Gorague,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I believe it an Effect of Providence, that theſe Two Nations know not their own Intereſt, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neglect it. Heaven is more kind to us; for, as our Empire tranſcends all others in Strength and Greatneſs, ſo it does in Unity and Concord, by which means 'tis in our Power to make War or live in Peace. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> never conſider the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they loſe, and the Good they may acquire by attacking of us, whom they yet hate and treat as <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> is at preſent General of the <hi>French</hi> Naval Forces; who, though a Prieſt, is yet permitted to turn <hi>Tarpaulin</hi> and Soldier: For my part, I underſtand not how a Prelate of his Rank can forſake his Flock, his Altar and his Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>If what the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſay be true,</hi> but that is nothing to us; and the King of <hi>France</hi> being ſo enlightned a Prince, and imploying him, as he does, he muſt needs be a good Seaman and Soldier.</p>
                  <p>To ſay no more in this Matter. <hi>For Princes of what Religion ſoever they be, are always ſacred, and not to be approached but with Reſpect, ſeeing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings lie above the Reach of a common Capacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would fain hear of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Health; for, when he is well, all the World is ſo to me, and without him I am nothing. I will not write ſo ſoon to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> being deſirous to write what paſſes here with more Exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>I am in this Place like a Man loſt in Confuſion; for, this Town ſeems rather a Province than a City. All is Hurry and Noiſe, every Body bruſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout after Action.

                  <p>I Have been at a Ceremony which I am willing to ſee often, to give an Account of it in my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; 'tis the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes cauſe to be ſung in their Churches, on the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any conſiderable Advantage over their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; which <hi>Te Deum</hi> is an Hymn compoſed by two of their Saints, to wit, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auſtin.</hi> When the <hi>French</hi> beat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> they ſing the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and when theſe vanquiſh their Enemies they do the ſame. Theſe Two Nations do the duty of the <hi>Muſſulmen,</hi> in deſtroying one another; and when this is done, they give God Thanks for the Evil they have committed. Whence we may judge of the Wiſdom and Piety of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there's ſeldom ſeen an open War, and if it ſhould happen, 'tis generally Condemned.</p>
                  <p>The Rejoicing of the <hi>French</hi> proceeds hence; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had beſieged <hi>Leucate,</hi> a ſmall <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which is but four Leagues round, with Two Ports, where a few Galleys, and Four ſmall Veſſels may Anchor in ſafety. The Place was attack'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with much Heat, but was afterwards given over with as great Loſs. The Aſſailants being obliged to make a Retreat,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46436:16"/>not unlike a ſhameful Flight; quitted their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, their Arms and all their other Proviſion.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Serbellon</hi> offered at firſt to <hi>Barris,</hi> who commanded the Place, a great Sum of Money, which was to be attended with a conſtant Penſion; which refuſed, they were neceſſitated to betake themſelves to force, by which, in ſhort, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were entirely defeated. <hi>Serbellon</hi> withdrew towards <hi>Perpignan,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Cardonn</hi>'s Son, who was Viceroy of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> He loſt all his Tents, his Plate, and the Moneys deſigned for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army: And I will ſay yet more, that he has loſt the Reputation of a good Captain and valiant Soldier, <hi>until he can recover an Opportunity to Fight and Vanquiſh.</hi> This Victory muſt have been of Conſequence, and very Glorious, ſeeing the King aſſiſted in Perſon, together with the Queen, Two Cardinals, the Council of State, and that of the <hi>Finances,</hi> and that which they call here, <hi>the Courts Sovereign,</hi> which are a Company of Men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to judge others.

                     <hi>To the</hi> Aga <hi>of the</hi> Janiſaries.</head>
                  <p>I Shall give thee ſome Pleaſure in telling thee, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſe eaſier than they acquire. It ſeems, the Marqueſs <hi>Ambroſe Spinola,</hi> whom all the World took for a great Captain, has loſt much of his Reputation; ſeeing, that a Place is loſt in eleven Weeks, which he had formerly beſieged eleven Months, and where he had expended eleven Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If theſe Circumſtances are true, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary. However, he ſhall continue a Great Captain in my Opinion; and it is ordinary enough to ſee that loſt in a little Time, by the Cowardlineſs of one, which has not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a great while by the Valour of a whole Army.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath taken <hi>Breda,</hi> a Place of great Importance, which had been ſurrendred twelve Years and three Months ſince to the ſaid <hi>Spinola,</hi> who commanded the Army of <hi>Spain.</hi> This Conqueſt is great; for, 'twas the general Opinion, the Place could not be taken but by Famine; yet hath it been conſtrained to yield, by the continual Fire and Valour of the Beſiegers.</p>
                  <p>Had not the <hi>Hollanders</hi> become Maſters of this Place, they had been, as it were, block'd up on the ſide of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and had the Enemy always at their Gates; whereas, now they are more at large. We ought to rejoice rather at their acquiſitions, than thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards, with whom we never have had Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Place, is fortified with much Regularity. It hath fifteen Baſtions, beſides ſome little Forts on the Moat ſide. There are five Horn-works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The Place is conſiderable for its Greatneſs.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46436:18"/>It contains five thouſand Houſes, with great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and there are three principal Gates.</p>
                  <p>I mention theſe Particulars, becauſe thou art a Man of War. Receive my Letter kindly; believe me thy Friend, and do not doubt of my Fidelity. If thou wilt add to thy Valour by new Merit, which will heighten the Conſideration Men have for thee, I will teach thee a Secret, which will not be very Expenſive, but very Delightful. Read at Times the Hiſtories of others, and particularly thoſe of the Greateſt and moſt Fortunate Princes, and their Captains. Imitate rather the Wiſe, than thoſe who have only ſignalized themſelves by their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. To conclude, be converſant in Hiſtories, but chooſe always the beſt, I mean ſuch as cannot be ſuſpected for Lyes. Thou canſt not fail of good Books, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> which are Tranſlated into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongues. Thou wilt learn to be wiſe by the Folly of others, and wilt become yet more Prudent, by obſerving the ſage Conduct of ſuch who performed great Actions: Above all Things, never neglect to make ſerious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the leaſt Events. It happens ſometimes that paſſages are found in Books that ſeem of no Conſequence, which may yet be of Uſe in important Occaſions, for the clearing of Difficulties. And for Example, learn this from a great King, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. who Conquered his Kingdom by the Dint of his Sword.</p>
                  <p>I will finiſh with a worthy Saying of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Spinola</hi>'s, which I think is to the purpoſe. He ſaith, That a Captain's Sword muſt be tyed to his Heart, his Heart fixt to his Head, and Conducted by his Judgment; which ought parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to be formed by the reading of Hiſtories. Love me as much as I eſteem thee, and thou wilt never love me enough.</p>

Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the Confidence we have in each other is arrived to that Degree, as to diſcover our failings to each other, and to ſuffer them. Seeing I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent far off, and by conſequence the more expoſed to Criticks and ill Offices, do not forget the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of thy Friend. Watch Day and Night for the Advantage of my Life. Obſerve, ſearch and endeavour to penetrate what People diſcourſe of me, and what is ſaid concerning me at Court. Our Great Emperor ſent me hither to obſerve what paſſes here, and render him an Account. I know I am where I ought to practiſe what I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do, but I do not yet know whether I ſhall return to the place where I would willingly end my Days. Moſt things are done on that ſide, but they are not all equally performed. I have therefore more juſt Reaſon to apprehend, that all Men do know that I ſhall acquit my ſelf with Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, of the Orders I have received. Conſider how far his Unhappineſs doth extend, who ſerves another, who is Maſter of ſo many Millions of Subjects.</p>
                  <p>I will inform thee of <hi>two</hi> Things, whereof thou ſhalt tell the <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, and the <hi>other</hi> to the <hi>Muſti</hi>'s Vicar. We are told, that the King of <hi>England</hi> hath ſet forth a Veſſel upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ocean, of ſuch Prodigious Greatneſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46436:19"/>that it exceeds all others as well in Force as Vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is Armed with One hundred and twenty Braſs Guns. It draws Unrigg'd, Seventeen Foot of Water, and its Bulk is Eleven hundred Tun. 'Tis reported, that it coſt Two Millions of <hi>Piaſters,</hi> and as if it were the King of all other Ships, it is called <hi>The Sovereign.</hi> The Second News is, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy that happened in Upper <hi>Saxony,</hi> which finds but a little Credit with the Wiſe, but is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed by the Women, and the Common-People.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, That at <hi>Dreſden,</hi> one of the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Courtiers having cut a piece of boiled Beef, there iſſued ſo much blood out of it, that the <hi>Elector</hi>'s Table was wholly covered with it; which extreamly troubled this Prince, looking upon the Adventure as a Preſage of Famine and War. Let me hear often from thee, and of our Friends; but, make no Confidence to any, of that which is betwixt us. Thou ſhalt learn from me Secrets of great Importance, provided thou be Faithful and Diſcreet. <hi>God</hi> grant thee in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the Good which I ſhall wiſh to acquire in my whole Liſe.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46436:19"/>whither thou haſt ſent me; I will endeavour to penetrate the Affairs the moſt ſecret, to the end that nothing in this World may be hid from thee.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, there are but few Actions in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which deſerve to be reported; and, thou art ſufficiently inſtructed in the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> and touching the Perſon of her King. I expect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thee of Events, which at the ſame time may divert thee, and inſtruct thee. This Prince is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Henry the Juſt.</hi> He cannot be called <hi>the Happy;</hi> for, having as yet no Son to ſucceed him, there will be always Occaſions of Trouble in his Kingdom: Nor is there any Hopes that the Queen may prove with Child, by Reaſon of her long Barrenneſs. If the King will reſolve to be divorced from her, and take another, it cannot be effected without <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and all their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> will, according to their uſual Manner, raiſe ſo many Difficulties, and be ſo long before they determine, that it will be a hard Matter to extort from them, that Conſent which the Laws of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> render neceſſary for the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Firſt Marriage. Certainly, this Slavery which doth thus ſubject the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, is hard; but, it is a Point of their Law, which being of no Importance to thee, I will trouble thee no more with it. This defect of a Succeſſor in the King of <hi>France,</hi> is of great Advantage to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and one would think, Heaven had created this Nation to be Enemies to the <hi>French.</hi> It ſeems moreover, there is a ſecret Violence which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an Antipathy betwixt the Two Nations; which enforces a belief, that there can never be a ſolid Peace betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt already underſtood from thoſe I writ to, and who dare hide nothing from thee, what has happened here during the ſmall time of my ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe Quarters. I will not repeat little
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46436:20"/>Things; the Greatneſs of thy <hi>Genius,</hi> and the Eminency of thy Employment, have put thee far above every Thing that is not Extraordinary, that we ought to inform the of nothing but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Events.</p>
                  <p>I will not entertain thee with the taking of the Old Town of <hi>Sally,</hi> nor of the Diſorders in the New. Thou wilt have learned more ſwiftly from the Coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> Advices of the Hoſtile Acts which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have committed with their Ships of War, againſt that City, which the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> protects.</p>
                  <p>The Attempt was great, and is diſcourſed of here as a hardy Enterpriſe. The Vaſtneſs of thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will eaſily judge of the Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>They ſay here, that the King of <hi>France</hi> has writ to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he will willingly reſolve to make a long Ceſſation of Arms with his Enemies. If that happens, this Repoſe will ſerve but to encreaſe the Forces of both ſides, which may hereafter render the War more cruel. In the mean time, 'tis thought they deſign a General Peace, but Time will diſcover to the Politicians, what we cannot at preſent divine.</p>
                  <p>This Court is Great and Magnificent. It ſtays not long in a Place, and is very ſeldom at <hi>Paris;</hi> being in the Camp amongſt the Armies, or for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> of the Courtiers is different, but they have an equal Inclination for two Things very oppoſite, <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> and apply themſelves to both with much Conſtancy.</p>
                  <p>The Religion which they call <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and which has been the occaſion of ſo much Diſturbance to the Kingdom, is now low, by the Surrender of <hi>Rochell,</hi> which was, as thou knoweſt, the principal Bulwark of thoſe of that Party.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46436:20"/>
                  <p>It ſeems, this King will imitate our Mighty and Formidable Emperors, and will regulate his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by thine, in not ſuffering within his State two Religions which are oppoſite.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom is notwithſtanding, as yet, full of Trouble. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who holds the Helm of Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> as thou directeſt that of the Empire of the World, ſeems, as may be ſaid, in the midſt of a Tempeſt, and hath Reaſon enough to apprehend Danger; for there are an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People who follow the Standards of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> who have no other Thoughts but of his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Power of <hi>France</hi> ſeems mighty Great, and 'tis to be apprehended, it may in Time augment infinitely.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt, <hi>Invincible Baſſa,</hi> what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Gauls</hi> did in Old Time. They were called <hi>Gallogrecians;</hi> for having over-run <hi>Italy</hi> and ſack'd <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſettled in the middle of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and could not be overcome but by the <hi>Romans:</hi> becauſe the Heavens had ordained that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate all Nations. But now that theſe <hi>Gauls</hi> are no more, and there are no more of theſe brave <hi>Romans,</hi> we muſt pray the Infinite Goodneſs of the moſt High, that the Power of theſe Modern <hi>Gauls</hi> may be limited. If the <hi>French</hi> however would do what a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who fled from the Paſſion of <hi>Philip</hi> II. counſelled <hi>Henry</hi> IV. their King, which was, To ſet himſelf right with <hi>Rome,</hi> to have a great Power at Sea, and a Council compoſed of Wiſe, Secret and Faithful Men; by that means he might one day perhaps equal the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> I think he that gave this Advice was named <hi>Antonio Perez.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerve every thing with care, but ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them nearer for the future. It appears to me, that the <hi>Genius</hi> of this Nation is to aggrandize it ſelf, and extend its Limits.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:46436:21"/>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> have a common ſaying, That Kings having nothing above them that may limit them, <hi>God</hi> hath given the Empire of the Earth to the ſtrongeſt. They add, That <hi>Adam</hi> left no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to his Children, but that they made them for themſelves. They glory in certain Prophecies, which promiſe them the Empire of the World. In relating this, I tell what they ſay, not what ought to happen. They entertain here the ſame hatred for us, as others do when our Power is Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but, wiſe Men who have Knowledge of our Hiſtory, ſpeak with more Admiration of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, than of that of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and if theſe laſt were deſtroyed by the Civil Wars which tore them in pieces, the other will encreaſe and maintain it ſelf, by the great Pre-cautions uſed to hinder them, and by the Union of their Forces.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt more of the Extent of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> than I can tell thee. It appears to me, great and full of People; but, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is yet Greater, and more Populous.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt pardon me after all, if I make not a certain Judgment of a Nation, which I do not yet well comprehend. However, I will aſſure thee, the <hi>French</hi> are no Fools, and I believe never were. They do not love Novelty through Levity, but for Reaſon of State; and when they are unconſtant, it is not to do Ill, but to acquire Good. They are Happy and Unfortunate in Wars, like others; but, what is conſiderable, They do not combat their Enemies becauſe they hate them, but in Obedience to their Prince, which occaſions the great Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which is in their Armies. And, what ſeems worthy of Reflection, is, That they love their King by Inclination; and, this Love produces in them, that which our Attachment to the Precepts of the Law, does in the Hearts of the beſt <hi>Turks.</hi> I uſe this Compariſon, which I learnt from thee,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46436:21"/>who art the Wiſeſt Man in the World; from whoſe Mouth I have heard, as from an Oracle, That it is not much material, whether Subjects love their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by Inclination or Fear, provided they always faithfully ſerve him, and are always humble.</p>
                  <p>If ever it happen I am diſcovered, thou wilt do me a great Honour to let me know, If I ought to avow my ſelf an Agent from the <hi>ſublime Port;</hi> or, whether I ought to die without confeſſing any Thing.</p>
                  <p>I end with my Head in the Duſt, without ever ceaſing to ſupplicate the moſt High, that he will ſhower his continued Happineſs upon thee and the Empire.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Muzlu Reis Effendi, <hi>Principal Secretary of the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis is the ſecond Letter which I have writ to thee. My Diſpatches hitherto have not been filled with Things of great Importance, by reaſon I have not yet had Time to learn them. I wiſh greatly to write what may pleaſe thee. Receive therefore what I offer kindly, and be perſwaded, That I fear thy Cenſures, as much as if I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>
                  <p>I live here according to the Inſtructions which were given me, and live eaſie enough. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is good and fat, the Men good Companions, are frank and ſeem Diſcreet.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46436:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>I have not as yet any Acquaintance with Women, and yet it is neceſſary I find Means to introduce my ſelf into their Companies. It is a Sex that will not pardon, when they think themſelves neglected. They are proper to diſcover Things one would know, and to ſay them when one would have them publiſhed; and likewiſe, they as much penetrate into the Secrets of Hearts, as the moſt refined and ſpiritualeſt Courtiers. Further, there are many of them, that can conceal nothing, but what they do not know.</p>
                  <p>I frequent not the <hi>Monks</hi> but when neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If I ſee them, it is to ſeem Devout, upon Deſign of being introduced by them into the Houſe of a Miniſter of State, when I teach his Son the <hi>Greek</hi> Language.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not expect to find here the great Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility which is at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Town is ſo full of Coaches, of Horſes and Waggons, that the Noiſe ſurpaſſes Imagination. Thou wilt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find it ſtrange, that Men who are in Health, and have no ſore Legs, ſhould cauſe themſelves to be drawn in an Engine with four Wheels; but I more wonder to ſee, theſe ſame Men can reſolve to ſuffer the Inconveniency of the Noiſe, and of the Expence which they throw away out of Vanity. The more moderate <hi>French,</hi> which do not approve of this Luxury, ſay, That in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. there were but three Coaches in <hi>Paris,</hi> whereof two were the Kings. But the Number is now ſo great, that they are not to be counted.</p>
                  <p>I can tell thee no more of the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> thou knoweſt it perfectly. There is in all their Actions a Spirit very delicate, and an Activity like that of Fire.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, as if none but they knew the ſhort Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man's Life; they do every Thing with ſo much haſte, as if they had but one Day to live.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46436:22"/>
                     <hi>If they go on Foot, they run; if they ride, they fly; and if they ſpeak, they eat up half their Words.</hi> They love new Inventions paſſionately. I can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain of their Fidelity, though methinks we might ſuſpect ſuch, <hi>who do not read as they write, nor write as they ſpeak.</hi> They love Moneys, which they look upon as the <hi>firſt Matter,</hi> and <hi>ſecond Cauſe</hi> of all Things: They well-nigh adore it, and that is the Original Sin of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> ought to be deſtroyed to enrich many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Europe.</hi> Whence thou mayſt comprehend her Greatneſs, her Traffick, how Rich ſhe is, and how all Sorts of Arts do flouriſh in her.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Nobility is always ready to get on Horſe-back at their King's Commands: And they love War ſo well, that it is to be ſuppoſed, we ſhould have enough to do with them, if we were as near them as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and they did not want Infantry.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall hereafter obſerve every Circumſtance with ſo much Care, as well in this Kingdom as elſewhere, that nothing ſhall eſcape me. In the mean Time, I ſhall endeavour to get Acquaintance; but ſhall want more Moneys than is allowed me, to anſwer what is expected from me. Two Chequins a-Day, are more than enough to ſupport a Man that will live like a Cynick, but not ſufficient to introduce me into Houſes, to dive into their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and enable me to diſcover the Affairs of moſt Importance, according to my Commiſſion; ſo that thou muſt aſſiſt me to obtain more.</p>
                  <p>I hope to ſucceed in my Employment, if thou doſt not refuſe me thy Aſſiſtance, finding no Difficulty in the Execution of my Orders, but the Neceſſity of Lying, when I paſs for a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> I fancy I ſee <hi>Mahomet</hi> in a Rage, and believe my Soul loſt; though I am from my Heart more faithful in my Religion, than all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46436:23"/>Seeing I am reſolved to do a Thing to which I have ſo much Averſion, thou mayeſt be aſſured, I will bear all the Evil imaginable that can happen to me with Firmneſs, though in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I ought to hope nothing but Good.</p>
                  <p>Deliver, I beſeech thee, this incloſed Letter into the Hands of the moſt Venerable <hi>Mufti,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from him, if poſſible, a Solution of my Doubts. There is nothing that touches me nearer, than what regards my Religion, and with my Religion the Service of my Emperor.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Will die a true <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> though I ſhould ſee all the Croſſes of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſet up for my Puniſhment, and had before mine Eyes, all the Inſtruments of the moſt Cruel Tortures, that the Enemies of our Holy Religion could invent. But, ſeeing there is no Queſtion at preſent of dying, but of living to ſerve my Emperor, I beg of thee, Sovereign Prelate, that thou wilt be pleaſed to conſerve my Innocence, in giving me an ample Abſolution, or in impoſing a Penance that may cancel all my Crimes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> hath always been the Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>France;</hi> whence it is, that the Exerciſe of no other Religion but the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is ſuffered there; and thoſe who acknowledge the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46436:23"/>their <hi>Head,</hi> have the principal Management of the Affairs of Religion; and 'tis with theſe that the Rites of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church are more ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>I live here in Appearance, as if I were a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and a <hi>Catholick.</hi> I enter into their Churches, aſſiſt at their Ceremonies, kneel before the Croſs; and I appear with great Devotion and Humility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Images, which are had here in Veneration.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough, if the Life which I lead be not permitted me, as advantageous to the Affairs of State, and the Perſon of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that I commit Sacriledge, acting as I do, contrary to the Precepts of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> expreſſed in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am guilty of violating the Law which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed me, and deſerve death, if thou doſt not, by approving this Life I am obliged to lead, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me of both my Salvation and Life. 'Tis true, thou haſt already given me Abſolution from all the falſe Oaths I ſhall be neceſſitated to take, when they are for the Service of my Maſter; but, I am not aſſured this Abſolution extends far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſecure my Conſcience, when I abuſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things.</p>
                  <p>'Tis thy Province to decide this Point which is of ſuch importance to my Repoſe, which makes me expect thy Reſolves with impatience; if thou thinkeſt a Faithful <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> who conſerves his Religion in his Heart, and lives, as I do, amongſt the Enemies of the Law, worthy this Grace.</p>
                  <p>The intereſt of my Conſcience obliges me to demand, after what manner I ought to govern my ſelf, when I ſee them, who are effectively what I ſeem to be, practiſe the ſame Acts of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> will in a little Time celebrate their <hi>Carnaval</hi> or <hi>Shrove-tide.</hi> As ſoon as it is done, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> think of Faſting, having firſt aſſiſted at a Ceremony, where Aſhes are put upon their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46436:24"/>to make them remember, <hi>they were formed out of the Duſt, and ſhall return to Duſt again.</hi> It is at this Time they go to hear Sermons, their Prieſts explaining that which they call the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and frequent the Church more than ordinary. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves oftener to Works of Piety; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purged their Conſciences by Penances and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Confeſſions, which one Man makes to another, they eat of a certain Bread, which they call <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt;</hi> where, after certain Words pronounced by their Prieſt, they will have the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be really preſent under thoſe Apparent <hi>Species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Ceremony is an Obligation that good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> cannot diſpenſe with, it being ordained by their Law, and by their Great Prelate, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> They commonly call it Confeſſing, and Communicating, and Keeping <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Ought I hazzard my ſelf in committing ſo horrid a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and tempt, as I may ſay, God, by ſo great a Superſtition, and ſo irritate our <hi>Great Prophet?</hi> It may be ſaid, perhaps, that many <hi>Jews</hi> have done the ſame Thing, and do it yet every day to preſerve themſelves more ſecurely. But how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have been chaſtiſed by viſible Miracles from Heaven, and undergone terrible Puniſhments by the Ordinances of the Judges?</p>
                  <p>All theſe Reflections trouble my Spirit, O Holy Primate of the moſt Divine Law. I do not think it lawful <hi>to mock the Myſteries of any Religion whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> The God of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is the ſame that we adore: but <hi>Their</hi> Religion is quite oppoſite to <hi>Ours:</hi> There is a great Difference betwixt their <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> Crucifi'd, with all the Ignominies poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> do believe, and a <hi>Mahomet</hi> Immortal and Triumphant, a great <hi>Legiſlator</hi> and the Angular Stone of the firſt Empire of the World.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46436:24"/>
                  <p>Give me then poſitive Orders, to the end I may be eaſed of my Scruples, and may believe, That what thou permitteſt me, may be an Effect of thy Juſtice, and not of a Toleration which may be pernicious to me.</p>
                  <p>It is true, I may wave all theſe things, in feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have done them; but it will be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for my Affairs, not to exempt my ſelf, if that may be without a Crime.</p>
                  <p>Teach then a moſt Obedient Slave, what thou ſhalt believe moſt conducible to the Glory of God, and moſt profitable for the Service of our Sovereign Lord. I do not ſend thee my Doubts to puzzle thee, but to draw from thy great and ſublime <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> ſuch Lights as may diſſipate the Darkneſſes I live in.</p>
                  <p>This done, Sovereign Prelate, remember thy Humble Servant, and pray our Holy Prophet, that he will keep me from periſhing.</p>

                  <p>I tell thee then, I have ſeen this King thrice, nor doth he appear by his Countenance, by his Hair, or by his Shape, to be yet Old; neither would it be eaſie to divine the Number of his Years, if we were ignorant of the Day of his Birth; But, it is known to every Body, That this Prince was born the 27. of the Ninth Moon of the Year 1601, according to the Style of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>

                  <p>For my part, I fancy this King will ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Father, unleſs he Repudiate this Wife and marry another.</p>
                  <p>It is not permitted to be inquiſitive into the Cauſe of this Sterility. Hereby thou ſeeſt the Weakneſs of thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes who are ſubjected to the Laws of <hi>Rome,</hi> which think it a Crime to give themſelves Heirs that are not born of Lawful Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46436:25"/>tho' it often happens, that when ſuch are wanting, this Kingdom is expoſed to Ruine, by the Diſſenſions and Civil Wars, which, on theſe occaſions, are always inevitable.</p>
                  <p>The Moſt High, who hath always protected the Grandeur of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, hath left the <hi>Infidels</hi> in theſe Errors; to the End, that he might give our moſt Mighty Monarch, who is the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> an Eminence Superior to that of all Kings, who are his <hi>Slaves;</hi> and at the ſame Time, made him Holy above all the Saints in the World; and permitted us to have Children, that may ſucceed us, from as many Wives as we can entertain; the Children of True Believers being always Legitimate.</p>
                  <p>I humbly beg Pardon; I forgot I ſpoke to thee, who art Wiſdom it ſelf, and to whom no Secrets of the Law or State are unknown.</p>
                  <p>I wlll ſend to <hi>Carcoa</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Pictures of the King, of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Son, and of the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> according to the Orders I received from thee, and they ſhall be diſpatch'd in little Time: I would to Heaven I could as eaſily ſend thee the Originals; I ſhould at one Stroke diſarm this Kingdom, which would thereby be ſuddenly involved in Fire and Blood.</p>
                  <p>The Habit I wear, and the Manner after which I live, hath already gained me many Friends. I find Means to go once a week to Court. My De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity protects me againſt the Jealouſies of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Some People take me for a Wiſe Man, and diſcourſe confidently in my Preſence of Politicks and Affairs of State; neither do I neglect the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Uſe of every Thing, which may be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me in my Miniſtry. Thus, in doing a Thing for the which I have much Averſion, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all I deſire; and I aſſure thee, upon my Faith, If thou wilt continue to protect me and aſſiſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46436:26"/>me with thy Counſels, I will do ſomewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                  <p>I ſupplicate the Great <hi>God,</hi> to give a perpetual Health to thy Body, and make thy Soul enjoy, upon Earth and in Heaven, the Felicity of the Bleſſed.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Bedredin, <hi>Superior of the Convent of</hi> Derviſes, <hi>of</hi> Cogny <hi>in</hi> Natolia.</head>
                  <p>I Write to thee, who art Venerable by thy Age, and ſo many long Voyages, which thou haſt made. Thou, who haſt been ſo many Times in Pilgrimage to <hi>Arabia, Tartary, Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> always bare-foot, and begging, out of pure Devotion to the Saint of Saints, our Great Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I addreſs this Letter to thee; Thee, who beareſt the Scars of five and twenty Great Wounds; Thee, who haſt pray'd nine and fifty Times in the Sacred Porch, and adored the Holy Myſteries in the moſt retired Sanctuary of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and haſt lived more than ſeventy Years of Religion amongſt the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes,</hi> where thy Merit cauſed thee to be elected Superior of the Convent in <hi>Natolia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt well, that I ſerve him, who is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator of the Deſtiny of the Univerſe; I mean the <hi>Sultan,</hi> Sovereign of the World. Learn what I heard here from the Mouth of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and pardon me, if I have not ſufficiently anſwered them; but do not accuſe me to have deſerved Death, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46436:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>having ſeemingly curſed our Holy Law, and <hi>Him</hi> that gave it us; and, if I have ſeemed to reject his Succeſſors, <hi>Ali, Oſman,</hi> and <hi>Omar,</hi> it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that I ſhould commit <hi>ſome</hi> Evil, not to loſe the Opportunity of doing <hi>much</hi> Good.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt well, I am deſtined to ſerve; and, that being abſolved from all the Perjuries I ſhall commit, I may tranſgreſs the Law, by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to lye. That ſuffices: Read my Letter, and learn how far their Malice does extend, who are Enemies to our Religion.</p>
                  <p>To inſtruct thee better in what has happened to me, I muſt tell thee, that amongſt theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> there is an Order of <hi>Religious</hi> much in <hi>Vogue,</hi> called <hi>the Company of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S:</hi> wherein, there is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Company of Men, ſome more able than others in all Sorts of Scienes ſacred and prophane; and, according to Appearance, ought to be very recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for the Holineſs of their Manners.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Religious,</hi> who are ordinarily called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> have the Education of the Youth almoſt in all the Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and many excellent Wits are brought up in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries they have eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When they preach, the People crowd to their Sermons. They are the Confeſſors of almoſt all the Princes and Monarchs of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who diſcover to them their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, their Sins, and the Vices whereunto they are enclined, and receive from them, upon their Knees, like Slaves, ſuch Penance as they think fit to impoſe on them.</p>
                  <p>A Man may ſay of them, That being Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Penances, they are alſo the Maſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences. They are Habited in a long Veſt of black Wooll, which deſcends to their Heels. They go not bare-foot, but their Veſtments are ſimple. They obſerve great Modeſty in all their Actions; they march with Gravity, never go alone, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46436:27"/>not their Beards to grow. They apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to edify the Good, and to correct the Bad.</p>
                  <p>The Founder of this Order was a Souldier, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> will have him to have been of their Nation; and the <hi>French</hi> affirm, that he is of that Part of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which is ſubject to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> If thou wouldſt have me to ſpeak the Truth, I think this Founder was a good Man, ſeeing all his Diſciples are Men of good Example, of great Modeſty in their Actions, and very Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet in all their Undertakings.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ignatius</hi> began to ſtudy his Grammar in his ſeven and thirtieth Year, which would make one believe, he took leſs pains to become a Saint than a Scholar. His Enemies call his Diſciples, <hi>the Politicians of the Church;</hi> and I, on the contrary, call them the Camels of <hi>Eſau;</hi> becauſe, in bearing the Burthen of the Affairs of their Religion, they are loaded more than others, and forced to couch under their Burthens. There is one thing ſeems ſtrange in them, to wit, That they ſhould name themſelves the <hi>Religious</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> as if they had a deſign, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from other Chriſtians; and that this Title, which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to them, ought not only to agree to all the other <hi>Religions,</hi> but to all the Followers of the <hi>Nazarite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they follow the Precepts of their Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> thou muſt needs approve their Way of living. He has taught no other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay than that of Obedience, to thoſe that profeſs his Order. He ordains, That thoſe who enter into this Society, do abandon themſelves to the Diſcretion of their Superiours: And they affirm, That if the Pope commands them to paſs the Sea in a Veſſel without Oars, without Sails, and without a Rudder, they would obey, and muſt paſs. And ſome having reproached them, That there was Folly in ſuch blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46436:27"/>they anſwer, That Wiſdom ought to be obſerved in the Commandments, and that it ought not to be ſearched in Obedience. Make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon this Sentence, which is conformable to our Laws.</p>
                  <p>To inform thee of the Power and Greatneſs of this <hi>Order,</hi> it ſuffices to tell thee, That during ſixteen Years that this Souldier govern'd it, he ſaw an Hundred Colleges in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Spain;</hi> and that in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was founded by <hi>Borgia,</hi> hath been, as may be ſaid, the Parent of all the reſt. Judge hereby the Number of their Houſes, and Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Having one day met with one of this <hi>Society,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Oriental Languages;</hi> and who converſing with me, did not believe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> I heard him vomit injurious, and fearful Imprecations againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> againſt his Law, and againſt all <hi>true Believers.</hi> I have ſo much Horror to write to thee all he ſaid, that I will tell thee but ſome few of them; and the rather to divert thee, by the knowledge of the Errors of our Enemies; and alſo, that thou maiſt not be afflicted at ſome things not very reaſonable, which are obſerved in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Precepts of the Law, which we follow. Let this be ſaid, as if I had not ſpoken it, ſeeing I pour frankly the Secrets of my Heart into thy Boſom: no ways doubting, but thou knoweſt to be ſilent in what may cauſe my Death. This <hi>Jeſuit</hi> maintains, That the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> are not Wiſe in following the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of a Drunkard, who forbad drinking of Wine, and committed Exceſſes himſelf, when he thought he was un-obſerved. He maintains further, That it is fooliſh to give Credit to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46436:28"/>ſuch a Fellow, who makes a Paradiſe to conſiſt of Beautiful Women, where one may abandon himſelf to all ſorts of Pleaſure and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and that he hath not foreſeen a Hell, where he, and all his Followers, ought to ſuffer the Pains due to their Crimes. He adds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That one muſt be very fooliſh to adore a Blaſphemer, who hath commanded his Law ſhould be maintained by the Sword, when it could not be ſupported by Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Father did not leave off ſo; he ſaid, That ſeeing the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is filled with Dreams, with Beſtialities, with Blaſphemies, and Impurities; the <hi>Mufti's,</hi> the Doctors, and Interpreters of the Law, muſt be in a great Blindneſs, not to condemn a Poſſeſſed, an Enchanter, who gives for the Precepts of his Religion, the committing of Violences, Robberies, and all that may ſatisfie the moſt Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Appetites. What Extravagancy, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he, to adore the Heel of ſo vile a Slave as <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and to believe, upon his Report, that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Father was his Porter, to Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Camel, and to place it in Heaven? He adds further, That there is nothing ſo abſurd, as to command the <hi>Turks</hi> to waſh their Bodies, when their Souls are defiled with Filth; to give them at the ſame time Charity by Precept, and to command them Robberies by Devotion. It ſeems alſo to him fooliſh, to believe that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is the only true Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſon to <hi>God;</hi> and to ſwear afterwards by One hundred twenty four thouſand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. He ſtill entertains me with this Sort of Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>But all this (O great <hi>Dervis</hi>) is nothing; he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits yet this damnable He eſie, That the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46436:28"/>Wretches, and the moſt deteſtable that ever liv'd, were <hi>Judas, Mahoment,</hi> and <hi>Luther;</hi> That theſe two laſt, as moſt impious, are the more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Hell. <hi>Judas,</hi> he ſaid, ſuffered leſs Pains, becauſe if he betrayed his Lord, he was one of the Inſtruments of the Redemption of all Mankind; whereas the others, in damning themſelves, damn'd alſo an infinite Number of other People. This <hi>Jeſuit</hi> would have continued his Blaſphemies, if Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> in whoſe Anti Chamber we were, had not come out of his Cloſet, to go to the King.</p>
                  <p>I had been ſilent all this while, becauſe he gave me not a Moments liberty to ſpeak. At length, he asked me at parting, If I was not of his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I anſwered preciſely thus; My Father, If thou art a good Man, I approve what thou ſayſt, becauſe thou ſpeakeſt out of true Zeal; but, If thou beeſt a Hypocrite, I diſapprove all, becauſe thou ſhalt be damned with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and all the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſmiled, not comprehending the Venom which lay hid in my Anſwer. Btu, doſt thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thou, who art a <hi>Dervis,</hi> the moſt illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That a Man, of what Religion ſoever he be, provided he be a Good Man, may be Happy after his Death? Tell me, I pray thee, thy Opinion herein; it is a Point very important to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>
                  <p>As for me, I begin really to think, That there may be Saints, even amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as there are amongſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> I have ſeen and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood many Things that denote true Piety in ſome of them; and we muſt acknowledge, That the Precepts of their Law have ſomewhat of Juſt; and if they be well obſerved, they ſeem no leſs Holy to me than our own. They have one Article that puzzles me. They affirm, There is but one Truth;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46436:29"/>ſo that we are loſt, if we are not <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or they are damned, if they are not <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is what I had to ſay to thee in this Matter; but, I ſhall not end this Diſcourſe, without ſome violent Scruples of Conſcience. Pray the Great <hi>God</hi> with me, That he will illuminate my Underſtanding with Inward Lights, until the Man promiſed by our Holy Prophet; the Man, I ſay, who ought to be born of his Race, be deſcended upon the Earth; who is to ſee all Kings humbled in his Preſence, and to unite with <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Two Religions that they may make but One.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, let us live as honeſt Men, who have Sin in horror, like the Plague, which poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Soul; and apply our ſelves, as much as in us lies, to what is truly Good; and above all things, let us carefully obſerve this Precept, writ in the Book of their Law, but is not always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in their Hearts, <hi>Never do to Others, no not thy Enemies, that which thou wouldſt not have done to thy ſelf.</hi> A Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> gave an Example of this to all <hi>France;</hi> and 'tis what thou oughteſt to Preach in the vaſt Empire of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> This Prince ſurprized a Villain that would have Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated him, who confeſſed, that the Intereſt of his Religion (which was that of <hi>Calvin</hi>) had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to form a Deſign to take him away, to deliver himſelf, and thoſe of his Party from ſo great an Enemy. The Duke, inſtead of cauſing him to ſuffer the Pains due to ſo black an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, Pardoned him, contenting himſelf to tell him, <hi>Friend, If thy Religion Obliged thee to Kill me, without hearing me, my Religion Obliges me to give thee thy Life and Liberty, now I have heard thee: Go thy ways, and amend thy ſelf.</hi> This Prince was then General of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX<hi>'s</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>Sage <hi>Bedredin,</hi> our <hi>Mahomet</hi> never ſhewed ſuch generous Sentiments, when he preſcribed in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46436:29"/>Law this Precept againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Offended him; <hi>When you Encounter the</hi> Infidels <hi>kill them, and cut off their Heads, impriſon them, and keep them in Chains, until they have paid their Ranſoms, or till you find it requiſite to ſet them at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Perſecute them until they have all ſubmitted, or are entirely overthrown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerve in this Letter, what may be of uſe to thee. Pardon my Friendſhip, the frank Manner of Writing, and remember <hi>Mahmut</hi> in thy Prayers, who perſonates a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and is in his Heart a moſt faithful <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> If it be in thy Power to ſuccour me, never do me any Injury. <hi>God</hi> protect and govern thy great Age to the laſt Moment.</p>

                  <p>THE Queen is with Child, when leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which occaſions much Joy at Court, eſpecially to the King; who, after ſo many Years of Marriage, will become a Father.</p>
                  <p>Thou, who haſt applied thy ſelf ſo long to the Studies of Aſtrology in the Schools of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet makeſt Profeſſion of this Divine Art, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thee Things the moſt hidden to thee; who readeſt ſo learnedly in the Book of Heaven, whatever the Stars have traced there, who haſt found the Moment of their Riſing and Diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the Intervals betwixt theſe two Times, and the Cauſes which render their Motion quicker,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46436:30"/>or ſlower; thou, who penetrateſt into the moſt hidden Secrets of Men, and knoweſt the Seaſons of Famine, of Shipwracks, of Victories, and of loſs of Battels: Divine in <hi>God</hi>'s Name, Great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the Secrets of Nature, Wiſer than <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazar</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> what will become of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnation; and whether it be true, That this Child that's to be Born, has been more than two hundred and ſeventy Moons in forming.</p>
                  <p>If thou believeſt what I writ laſt to thee to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ſay nothing of it; it would be no Credit to me, to paſs for the Author of a Novel, that has no Grounds of Truth.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Paris,</hi> is in an inconceivable Joy; and this Joy is ſpread all over <hi>France.</hi> Thou may'ſt perceive by that, the Paſſion of this People to ſee their King a Father. 'Tis true, they have much to hope by it; but it is as certain, they have yet much to apprehend, ſeeing all their Hopes vaniſh in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Nature uſes all her Power when ſhe forms a Man, the moſt perfect of all Creatures. But, there needs but a ſlight Fall, to deſtroy this Workmanſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is finiſhed, as well as after.</p>
                  <p>I have heard a great many People queſtion much the Sex, and Life of that which will be born.</p>
                  <p>All the Converſation at the Court, at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in all the Kingdom, is no more of Wars, of Leagues of Peace, or Naval Preparations; they all rowl upon the bringing to Bed of Women.</p>
                  <p>There will be other reaſoning in ſome ſmall time in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and even amongſt us, if the Queen do not miſcarry; <hi>France</hi> being no leſs conſiderable amongſt other Kingdoms, than the <hi>Bourbone</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men. <hi>Harry</hi> IV. who introduced the Crown into this Branch of the Family, was a Prince very Brave; and if we live long enough to ſee his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46436:30"/>Grand-Children, we ſhall ſee, whether they will have as much Courage as the Chief of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>As for thee, thou wilt have wherewith to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thee, and excerciſe thy Talent, if this Queen be brought to Bed happily of a Prince. I ſhall in the mean time be very Exact to mark, not only the Days and Hours, but the leaſt Minutes; to the End thou may'ſt know, by the Situation of the Planets, which ordinarily regulate the Inclinations of Men, in what manner, a Prince ſo long expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will regulate his Affairs, and conſequently thoſe of others.</p>
                  <p>It is a great while ſince we have had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce here with the Sun, there being forty nine Days ſince this beauteous Planet appeared to us; and the Cold is ſo violent, that it has changed (as I may ſay) the Waters of the <hi>Seine,</hi> a large River, into Cryſtal. Do not look upon theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as extraordinary; it happens here frequent enough; for, when the Days are ſhorteſt, the Cold is moſt intenſe. Thou knoweſt, that this Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is very inconſtant. I have often ſeen, in a little ſpace of Time, Rain, Hail, Snow, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Winds; and preſently after, the Air become Fair and Serene. This inconſtancy of the Climate, has its Advantages; for, if the <hi>fair</hi> Weather do not laſt long, the <hi>foul</hi> is alſo of leſs Duration.</p>
                  <p>Fail not, upon the Receipt of my Letter, to communicate the News I ſend thee, to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> without telling him the Reflections which I make. They are of no Uſe to ſuch great Miniſters; particularly by us, who are, in Compariſon of them, but vile Slaves; always ſubject to the Sentences they pronounce of us.</p>
                  <p>Love me, and conſult the Stars, to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt be always Faithful to me; and, if it be by Force, or Inclination.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Three Heads, are the principal of <hi>France,</hi> if not of all <hi>Europe:</hi> The Firſt, by Reaſon of a great and potent Kingdom, which is this Day more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing than all others: The Second by Reaſon of his Nobility or Royal Blood, and by his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Courage: And the Third, by a Wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in a Miniſtry full of Difficulties; being, as it were, the abſolute Maſter of Diſgraces and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> William Voſpel, <hi>a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>of</hi> Auſtria.</head>
                  <p>I Am obliged to thee for the Confidence thou haſt in me, in declaring to me thy Loſſes. Another would have rejoiced in hearing of thy Two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures; but, as I do not believe it is a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to loſe a Wife, ſo I cannot think it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable-Good to turn <hi>Monk.</hi> It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to forbear telling thee, That I find thy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46436:32"/>Reſolution too ſudden to approve of it. Thou art not the Cauſe of the Loſs thou haſt ſuffered, and yet retireſt into a <hi>Convent</hi> to do Penance, as if thou hadſt committed a Crime.</p>
                  <p>Is it neceſſary thou torment thy Body for the Death of a Wife, if thou haſt not Murthered her? If thou didſt love her, becauſe ſhe was Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, it is not impoſſible to find another as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. If her Beauty charmed thee, there are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that may pleaſe; but, if thou wert weary of being a Husband, why art thou then of being a Widower? Tell me, What wilt thou do at preſent in the <hi>Convent</hi> thou art ſhut up in? The <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> are <hi>Wiſe</hi> indeed, but know not <hi>all</hi> Things. It is true, they are very Devout, but not exempted from Sin: Finally, they are Men, and too auſtere. How canſt thou ſo ſuddenly accuſtom thy ſelf to that kind of Life thou haſt choſen, and <hi>become at once Chaſt and Sober?</hi> As for me, who am a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> as thou art, and more reſtrained in my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures than thou haſt hitherto been, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I ſee in that <hi>Order</hi> thou art entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; neither can I figure to my ſelf, how a Man bare-footed, without a Shirt, covered with a coarſe Habit of Wooll, who is no Maſter of Crowns, and who hath no Armies, ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely command, not only another Man, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who obey blindly what he requires of them.</p>
                  <p>To live well in thy Order, thou muſt Faſt; the leaſt Faults are not Pardon'd; thou muſt receive Offences with Thanks: Finally, the Combat is aſſured and conſtant, and there is but little Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Crown which ought to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thy greateſt Friend is obliged to betray thee, and thou wilt be deprived (as it may be ſaid) of the Elements, to make thee deſire the uſe of Water, Air, Earth and Fire. I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that there are ſo many Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46436:32"/>to make a Saint; for, when thou loveſt <hi>God,</hi> as much as it is in thy Power to do, and paſſeſt every Day, as if it were thy laſt, I believe thou wilt Live and Die a Juſt Man. Return me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and let me know, If what I write to thee be Conformable to right Reaſon; or, that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in my Opinion. The Friendſhip I have for thee, obliges me to write as I do, and to tell thee all I think that regards thee; becauſe, after thou haſt taken thy laſt Reſolution, I would rather ſee thee ſuffer with Conſtancy, all the Evils imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than to ſee thee change with Confuſion. There are many, who have abandoned with Shame, the Places which they entered in Triumph; and, how many have been puſhed by their Deſpair, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Follies which ſeemed Actions of Piety, which they had never undertaken in their right Wits?</p>
                  <p>We ſee in our Hiſtories, That many Great Men have cauſed themſelves to be Circumciſed, thereby to have Commerce with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and be Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Doctrines, finding their Ancient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Magnificent, Venerable, Holy, and full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. We alſo read, That <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Cloathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in White, and ſtaid ſome time amongſt the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litaries</hi> of Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> to learn the Myſteries of their Religion. His Curioſity was the Occaſion of this great Man's Voyage, as their Ignorance had cauſed the ſame Deſign in others. It is not the Deſire to be inſtructed, which made thee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Convent;</hi> the Affliction for the loſs thou haſt ſuffered, made thee take this Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Take heed of quitting it by a Repentance, which would prove an Exceſs of Folly. The <hi>Jews</hi> are at preſent, Vagabonds without Law, without a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without Altars; and, according to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> they will be Metamorphoſed into Aſſes, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Souls of the Wicked <hi>Mahometans</hi> into Hell. Who knows what will become of the <hi>Carmelites?</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:46436:33"/>They ſay <hi>Elias</hi> is not Dead, but is to return to the Earth, to combat thoſe Men who ſhall riſe to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World about the eſtabliſhing a New Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Stay ſtill where thou art, or return preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from whence thou cameſt; leſt after too long a ſtay, to come out in form, thou commit a Fault, that <hi>God</hi> will not eaſily pardon; which will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happen, if thou perſwade thy ſelf, That thou canſt not find the Way to Heaven, but out of the Noiſe of this World.</p>
                  <p>If thou doſt not find I adviſe thee well, do thou better; but, above all things, govern thy ſelf ſo, that <hi>God</hi> may not reproach thee one Day, That a <hi>Moldavian</hi> gave thee good Advice, and thou didſt neglect it. The <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>Turks,</hi> might give the ſame Advice that I do, as a <hi>good Chriſtian;</hi> and it would be no ſurprizing thing, if thou Receiveſt <hi>better</hi> from a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> Theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Inſtructed in Morality, to Teach others that which they do not always Practiſe themſelves. Vertue and Truth are reſpected every where. Turn thee from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> thou wilt find on all Sides impious Men who Blaſpheme againſt the Deity; but, true Vertue has that of ſingular, That <hi>ſhe is always Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and even by the moſt Profligate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſult once again thy Forces and thy Courage, and take a <hi>better</hi> Reſolution, if thou art not yet well fixed in thy <hi>firſt.

                  <p>AS the Knowledge which I ſhall have of Affairs will augment daily, ſo I ſhall have the more Matter to write; and will omit no Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark what occurs, which I will not fail immediately to communicate. Thou, who with great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerveſt what paſſeſt amongſt Men, and art deſirous of knowing the moſt ſecret Tranſactions of Potentates; thou may'ſt obſerve, That there are more violent Enmities betwixt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> than all the other Princes of the World.</p>
                  <p>I cannot comprehend whence it is, that theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> cannot live in Peace, and perhaps they do not comprehend it themſelves. It ſeems a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Heaven, That Man ought to be contrary to Man, and that whilſt there are Kingdoms there will be Wars and Enmities.</p>
                  <p>The Wars which are carried on at preſent in <hi>Alſace,</hi> look as if they would laſt long. The Death of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the ſecond Scourge of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who was ſlain Six Years ſince, did not terminate the Differences of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> they are greater than ever; and there appears in the New Generals of the Armies, vaſter Deſigns than thoſe in their Predeceſſors. Perhaps they will revenge the Death of <hi>Guſtave,</hi> who was kill'd, not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46436:34"/>as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> affirm; but by one of the Forty <hi>Germans,</hi> who had bound themſelves by Oath, never to quit their Swords before they had ſlain him, as the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtorians do write.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Bernard Weymar,</hi> of no leſs Valour than <hi>Guſtave,</hi> commands the reſt of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, with a good Number of <hi>French</hi> Troops, and many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Hereticks of <hi>Germany</hi> Victory attends the Arms of this General; and, the Princes which are united for Defence of the Empire, begin to apprehend a Captain, who obſerves leſs the Rules of War than the Emotions of his Valour, and whom they perceive ſeconded by Fortune. But, he doth not conſider, That in weakening an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he doth augment the Forces of a King, who will enjoy the Fruits of his Labours, and ſuppreſs him, in Spite of his Bravery, when he pleaſes. In the mean time, I am of Opinion, That it is our Intereſt, that <hi>Weymar</hi> be always Victorious. It may be ſaid of him, That he hath ſold to <hi>France,</hi> all but his Glory, having reſerved nothing for himſelf but Hope.</p>
                  <p>All that this Duke can Conquer from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is for the <hi>French</hi> King, who furniſhes him with Troops, with Arms and with Moneys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides wiſe Advice. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who is an able States man, fails not to perſwade his Maſter, That the Places, which <hi>Weymar</hi> ſhall take in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> with the Army which he Commands, are the Effects of his Councils, and his Majeſty's Moneys. The <hi>French</hi> begin to preſerve their Conqueſts, and know how to defend the place which are ſubject to their Power.</p>
                  <p>This Prince makes Acquiſitions, which are in truth, of more Importance, than they ſeem conſiderable for their Greatneſs. He took <hi>Rhinfeld</hi> almoſt as ſoon as he had Beſieged it. The Place was ſtrong, ſeated near the <hi>Black Foreſt,</hi> where the Garriſon was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46436:35"/>with Abundance of all Sorts of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John de Wert,</hi> General of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, had reliev'd it with Nine Regiments of Horſe, and Five Thouſand Foot. He defeated <hi>Weymar</hi>'s Horſe, took part of his Baggage and Artillery. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a great Captain, and great States-man, was hurt, and taken Fighting; and the City relieved with Men, Ammunition, and Victuals, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the taking of it more Glorious.</p>
                  <p>They write, that Two <hi>Imperial</hi> Generals, the ſaid <hi>John de Wert,</hi> which had ſuccoured <hi>Rhinfeld, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henfort,</hi> as alſo Duke <hi>Savelli,</hi> had been taken in a Combat which preceded the Rendition of the Place, beſides Thirty Eight Cornets and Nineteen Foot Captains. Theſe Spoils were gained by the Blood of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King; who after he had cauſed them to march through all the Streets of this Great City, commanded them to be hung up in the Principal Church, where I ſaw and conſidered them, as Marks of the Triumphs of Policy. The Siege of this Place laſted but Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Days.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> after this Victory, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Durlach,</hi> where he took the Caſtle of <hi>Rotelen.</hi> Defended by the King of <hi>Hungary;</hi> in which he found great ſtore of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and all ſorts of Ammunitions, which ſerved greatly for the refreſhing of his then needy Army.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, Duke <hi>Savelli</hi> eſcaped out of Priſon, and retired to <hi>Luzerne</hi> in <hi>Switzerland.</hi> The Officers that guarded him, were accuſed of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring his Eſcape, which coſt them their Heads.</p>
                  <p>All I write to thee is moſt true, and thou may'ſt cauſe my Letters to be inregiſter'd. <hi>God</hi> grant that <hi>Briſac,</hi> together with all <hi>Alſatia,</hi> may fall into the <hi>French</hi> Hands, and that the Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> be ſubjected to the Laws of the <hi>Oſmans.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Leganez,</hi> Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> having render'd himſelf Maſter of the Field, had laid Siege to <hi>Breme;</hi> and Marſhal <hi>Crequi,</hi> having in the Name of the King, his Maſter, undertaken the Defence of the young Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> 'Tis believed, the War will be cruel in this Quarter, being <hi>theſe</hi> are very Strong, and the <hi>other</hi> very Expert.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt know the Event. In the mean Time, all the Affairs of the <hi>French</hi> do not appear ſo For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in <hi>Italy;</hi> and, at this Hour that I write to thee, the Court laments the Loſs of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that Commanded their Armies in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>There is certain News of the Death of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Crequi,</hi> who was ſhot with a Cannon-Bullet through the Body, as he was going to view the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Works before <hi>Breme.</hi> This Loſs was by ſo much the more ſenſible to the <hi>French,</hi> in that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46436:36"/>they ſaw their Enemies make ſuch great Rejoycings at it.</p>
                  <p>All men conclude, this <hi>Crequi</hi> was both a good Souldier, and a good Captain; a wiſe man, and of Excellent Conduct. He had acquired great Reputation, for the King his Maſter, in <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſlew <hi>Don Philip,</hi> Baſtard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who challenged him in the ſight of Two Armies. He ſeveral Times defeated his Sovereign's Enemies in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and beat back the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> to the Gates of <hi>Milan.</hi> There remains no more of this Great Man, who did ſo many brave Things, but the bare Remembrance of 'em.</p>
                  <p>Scarce any thing of his Body, ſave his Entrails, was left for his Souldiers to celebrate his Obſequies with. His Soul is before the Throne of <hi>God;</hi> his Friends honour his Memory with their Elogies: his Kindred mourn for him, his Sovereign Praiſes him, and his Souldiers Crown his Tomb with Herbs and Flowers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> ſay highly upon this Occaſion, That <hi>Italy</hi> has been Fatal to the <hi>French,</hi> and that it will be ſo always. They affirm, That the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> will loſe his Eſtate, if defeated by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which he will likewiſe do by the Victory of his Friends. But, theſe are the Conjectures, and ordinary Reaſonings of Men, which I write to thee; to the end thou maiſt not only know what is done, but alſo the Diſcourſes which are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Events that happen. We ſhall ſhortly have News of the Siege of <hi>Bremen;</hi> in the mean time, it imports the <hi>French</hi> much, to conſerve the Opinion had of their Valour and Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Buſineſs in hand, is to defend a great and illuſtrious Houſe, which moreover pretends to the Sovereignty of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> troubled by the Ambition of Kindred, and the Politicks of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Theſe Ingagements import much to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46436:37"/>Princes, who have as many Maxims as differing Intereſts; but, we have nothing to do with the Differences of others.</p>
                  <p>May it pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> that our Affairs be always attended with an Equality of good Luck, for the Ruine of theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> Be thou conſtant in the Friendſhip thou promiſedſt me, and always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thy Friend, who recommends himſelf to thee, as the Law obliges thee to be to thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>

                  <p>I This day entertained a man which came from <hi>Italy,</hi> and hath ſerved in the <hi>French</hi> Troops. He gives this account of the Death of Marſhal <hi>Crequi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 17th. of this Mouth, this General having approached the Lines of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to view their Works, and to Fight them, in caſe he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it Expedient, a Cannon-Bullet ſeparated his Body in two, and the Bullet being taken up, they were ſurpriſed to ſee a Croſs graved upon it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which were alſo engraved Letters, which made theſe two Words, <hi>TO CREQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>I.</hi> This Bullet, the Croſs, and the Letters, cauſed no leſs Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the Death of this Captain did Sorrow, and every Body ſpoke his Sentiment of it.</p>
                  <p>Many treat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as Magicians and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers. Thoſe who are perſwaded of the Power
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46436:37"/>of <hi>Negromancy,</hi> affirm, That the Devil can carry a Bullet to the Place whither 'tis deſigned: others are of a contrary Sentiment, and believe, there is no Power without the Commandment of the <hi>Great God.</hi> There are others, who believe neither Charms, nor Characters, nor Magick; who, deſpiſing all theſe Superſtitions, attribute All to Deſtiny; and, I believe the ſame. <hi>Ahmet Celebi</hi> explains this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well in his <hi>Journal,</hi> which begins in the One thouſand twenty ſixth Year of our <hi>Hegira;</hi> when he affirms, That all things, which paſs here below, are effected by the Orders of Heaven. We cannot doubt (ſays he) but the Events which we ſee, are the Effects of the Will of <hi>God;</hi> yet, we muſt believe, he ſuffers all Things to happen by <hi>Second Cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had not <hi>Sultan Oſman</hi> irritated the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and <hi>Spahi</hi>'s, by throwing them into the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, when he ran diſguiſed through the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and found them drinking Wine in Taverns: And, had he not publiſhed his Deſign of Reforming this <hi>Militia,</hi> and tranſporting the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat</hi> elſewhere; he had not, perhaps, been murthered with ſo much Ignominy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> ſent him a terrible Dream before his Death. He thought he ſaw our <hi>Great Prophet</hi> ſnatching the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which he was then reading, out of his Hand; and taking from him, by Force, his Coat of Arms; and ſtriking him down with ſuch a great Box on the Ear, that he could not get up again. Thou knoweſt, he conſulted the Aſtrologers, and Interpreters of Dreams thereupon. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what he, who was his <hi>Praeceptor,</hi> ſaid, for it was plain Flattery: but we ſaw, what was foretold by the Aſtrologers, came punctually to paſs. Theſe had foretold, That the Emperor ſhould never ſee the Feaſt of <hi>Ramezan;</hi> becauſe the Star, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at his Birth, was much obſcured in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46436:38"/>with the Planet, that was then predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; which made 'em affirm, he would die in a very little Time. The Ignominy wherewith his Death was accompanied, was an Effect of Deſtiny; for, never any of the <hi>Ozmans</hi> ſuffer'd ſo much Shame. He had ſeveral Times ſeen the fatal Cord about his Neck without dying. A Soldier, in Charity, lent him his Handkercheif to cover his Head, which was without a <hi>Turbant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaid, all in Tears, to his Murtherers, <hi>Ye ſaw this Morning your Emperor upon the Throne, and this Evening you are for throwing him into a Dung-Cart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to carry Dirt into the Sea: You cannot live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and</hi> God <hi>will require a Reaſon for this Cruelty.</hi> Thou knoweſt, his reſiſting of thoſe that ſtrangled him, cauſed him to ſuffer much Pain. They took hold of him by the Secret Parts; and one of his Ears was cut off, and carried to the <hi>Valide,</hi> who expected the News of his Death. The Will of <hi>God</hi> appears in this Adventure; as alſo, the Power of <hi>Second Cauſes.</hi> Thou may'ſt ſee all this in that <hi>Journal</hi> of <hi>Ahmet.</hi> Had not Marſhal <hi>Crequi</hi> been in the Wars, he had not perhaps ended his Days by a violent Death; and had he not been ſo raſh as to approach too near to the Enemies Works, the fatal Bullet had not touched him.</p>
                  <p>We ſee hereby an Effect of <hi>God</hi>'s Will, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with our Conſent; becauſe we ſearch by our own Choice, that which we might avoid.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, accuſe me not of Ignorance, or Superſtition, if I have been long in entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, upon a Matter in Action, betwixt Man and the Devil. Thou knoweſt, that by Magick Art, we number the Twelve Spirits or Angels, which preſide over each of the Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which govern the Nations, People, and Cities committed to their Care. In like Manner, in the ſecret <hi>Cabala</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Twelve Anagrams
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46436:38"/>of the great Name of <hi>God;</hi> and, according to the Colour of the Stones where theſe Anagrams were engraved, they judged of the Future; performing thereby Things very aſtoniſhing. They have ſubjected our Bodies to theſe Twelve Signs, and divided them into Twelve Principal Members. But, how many ſurprizing Things are done with the Number <hi>Seven,</hi> to which they have applied the Seven Planets; by Means whereof, they diſcover the Secret of the good or evil Fortune of Men? Add to this, the Invocation of Spirits, and the Power of Figures, of Words, of Herbs, of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, of holy Characters, and ſo many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, wherewith they conſult the Black Angels; and thou wilt find, that Men do many Wonders by this Art, which they cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupernatural Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The little Bits of Paper, cut Triangular-wiſe, which <hi>Tokta Cham.</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s Embaſſador, cauſed to be thrown in the Night, round about the Imperial Tent of the Great <hi>Vizir Afis,</hi> in (each of which there was a certain Word writ) wrought more conſiderable Effects, than the <hi>Spaniard's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Bullet, which killed Marſhal <hi>Crequi.</hi> The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army revolted the Day following, as if poſſeſſed with Furies. The moſt Seditious took and bound the <hi>Vizir,</hi> and made him raiſe the Siege of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who had already diſmiſſed <hi>Muſtapha Aga,</hi> our Envoy, with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereby he ſurrendred this Place, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of the precipitate Retreat of our Army, cauſed <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to be called back; tearing the Treaty he had given him, in his Preſence; and bad him tell his General, He could not do ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Action, as to ſurrender ſo important a Place, to an Army that was running away.</p>
                  <p>Haſt thou ever heard of any Thing ſo Strange? Read this <hi>Ahmet Celibi</hi>'s Book, and thou wilt ſee,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46436:39"/>that all theſe Prodigies arrived in one Day. The Hiſtorian makes no Judgment upon this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he only reports it; neither do I believe it was an Effect of the Enchantment of theſe Bits of Paper, and the Characters contained in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is certain, our Army was greatly preſſed with Hunger. But in Effect, when <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> all in Tears, reproached the <hi>Vizir,</hi> That if he had gained but two Days Time, he had made a Peace equal to a Victory: <hi>Afis</hi> anſwered him, How couldſt thou with thy Tears, retain an Army poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with all the Devils of Hell, and reſolved to be gone?</p>
                  <p>If thou finiſh the reading of ſo long a Letter, accuſe thy Patience, and reproach not me with Tediouſneſs for having writ many Things to thee worthy of being known. After the Death of the <hi>French</hi> General, <hi>Breme</hi> was preſently delivered to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the Cowardlineſs of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who incurr'd, in time, a rigorous Deſtiny for it; having his Head cut off at <hi>Caſal,</hi> where they had impriſoned him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great God</hi> preſerve thee and thine for ever; and protect thee, againſt the ill Will of thoſe that do not love thee.</p>

                  <p>THE Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Savoy,</hi> finds her ſelf extreamly preſſed by the continual Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make into <hi>Piemont;</hi> they having beſieged <hi>Vercelle,</hi> a Place which covers the Country on the Side of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She her ſelf appears on Horſe-back, with great Courage, being reſolved to recover what is loſt, as well as to defend the reſt, which is in ſome danger; having joined her beſt Troops, with great Diligence, to thoſe of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Cardinal,</hi> which they call the <hi>Cardinal la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi> commands, in the Place of Marſhal <hi>Crequi,</hi> thoſe Troops of <hi>France,</hi> which conſiſt of Twelve thouſand Foot, and Four thouſand Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou doſt not know, perhaps, what theſe <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> are: They be the principal Prieſts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. Their Profeſſion is not to command Armies; though that ſometimes happens. either through want of ſage Captains, which theſe <hi>Infidel</hi> Kings may ſometimes ſtand in need of; or for other ſecret Reaſons, which are not always eaſie to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and muſt be of great Importance, <hi>France</hi> not wanting fit <hi>Seculars.</hi> A <hi>Roman Mufti,</hi> called <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> IV. gave the Purple Habit to theſe Prieſts; and obliged them to wear red Hats, Caps, and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, that this Colour might always put them in mind, they ought to ſhed their Blood for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Church and Religion.</p>
                  <p>I have been told, that formerly there were but Five and twenty, and now their Number is ſaid to be Seventy two; which is that of the Diſciples of the <hi>Chriſtian Meſſias;</hi> but, they are ſeldom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46436:40"/>I was deſirous of being preciſely informed, what the Dignity of a <hi>Cardinal</hi> is; and an old Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, that ſeems an honeſt Man, inſtructs me in all things, that regard the Religion, and Politicks of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He is ſuch an Enemy to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, that he gives often the uncleaneſt of all Meats to his Patients, ſuch as we think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, and cannot be eaten without Sin.</p>
                  <p>Thou that art a States-Man, and obliged to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at <hi>Council,</hi> and in the <hi>Divan,</hi> ought to know more Things than others, and thoſe more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                  <p>I will inform my ſelf, with care, of the Life, Actions, and <hi>Genius</hi> of this <hi>Cardinal la Valette,</hi> to know, whether the King, his Maſter, has any other reaſon, than that of his Valour and Experience in War, to make uſe of a Prieſt in his Armies, to ſhed Blood and ruine People; for, I never heard the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> did ever make uſe of a <hi>Cheik,</hi> to command the Armies of the Empire: Beſides, they are, without Experience, Fearful and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are more powerful in Infantry, and Cavalry, having Eighteen thouſand Foot, and Five thouſand Horſe; whereby they pretend to render themſelves Maſters of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and drive the <hi>French</hi> wholly out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Marquiſs of <hi>Leganez,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> affirms, That his King will not ſuffer the Children of the late Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to be under the Protection of Strangers. He ſays, That <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and other Places in the Power of the <hi>French,</hi> were uſurped upon the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and muſt be reſtored. They affirm, That the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> will hinder the Widow, her Children, and Subjects from being Oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Behold here an Example of the ſingular Piety of the <hi>Spainards,</hi> in Favour of a Widow and her Children; and on the other ſide, admire the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46436:40"/>of the <hi>French,</hi> who fight againſt theſe ſame <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the Conſervation of that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns neither of them. It will be difficult to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe ſecret Myſteries. Every Prince puts a value upon his Reaſons, as he does upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> came accompanied with a great number of Ladies, and the greateſt of her Court. She was on Horſeback at the Head of all the Company, both Horſe and Foot, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued the Army amidſt the Battallions.</p>
                  <p>She conjured, not only the Captains, but even the Corporals, and private Souldiers, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon her Defence. She ſhowed all the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Grief, that a Perſon of Courage could have, in ſeeing her ſelf expoſed to loſe her Eſtate; or to ſee her Children, in a manner, Captives; and, upon this Occaſion, ſhe failed not to mingle Torrents of Tears with the moſt charming Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which is ordinarily the ſtrongeſt Eloquence of Women.</p>
                  <p>The Army being ſenſible of the Dutcheſs's Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which ſhe had repreſented with all poſſible Earneſtneſs; the <hi>Cardinal Valette</hi> cauſed it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp to relieve <hi>Vercelle.</hi> He forced the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Lines, and put Two thouſand Men into the Place. The beſieged, fortified with ſuch Succours, made a great Sally, and much <hi>Infidel</hi>-Blood was ſhed on both Sides. But all that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> could do, with his Care, and the Dutcheſs with her Tears, could not hinder <hi>Vercelle</hi> to fall into the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that the Commander o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this Place, and his Garriſon, defended themſelves to the laſt Extremity; and, having no more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Lead, they fought at Puſh of Pike, with Stones; and finally, when all was gone, with their Fiſts.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:46436:41"/>
                  <p>But this is not believed here, it being alledged, that the Governor, or the General, did not do their Duty. The <hi>Cardinal,</hi> ſay they, failed in his Duty alſo; for, knowing they wanted Ammunition, yet he did not ſend it, though he found Means to put into the Place ſuch a great Number of Men. But the Governor is blamed yet more, that did not diſcover this his Neceſſity to the General.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee all theſe Particulars, to inform thee of the Manner how the <hi>French</hi> make War; many of whoſe Over-ſights would coſt us our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>There marched out of <hi>Vercelle</hi> Four Thouſand Men bearing Arms. Thence thou may'ſt judge, that our Generals are not cruel, when they cauſe the Heads of Commanders to be taken off, that behave themſelves ſo ill.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who has loſt her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, would, they ſay, marry a Prince of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> called the <hi>Cardinal Infant;</hi> which is an Effect of the Policy of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to have a better Pretence to attack <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and drive out the <hi>French,</hi> who entered there by Conſent of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was Soveraign thereof.</p>
                  <p>The valiant Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> is at length dead in a Caſtle near <hi>Berne.</hi> I think I writ he was hurt, and taken Priſoner in the Battel fought by the <hi>Swedes</hi> againſt the <hi>Germans.</hi> He was in the Sixty eighth Year of his Age, and was very conſiderable for his Erudition, Valour, and Experience in War. He was bred a Souldier from his Youth; was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employed in Military Affairs, and had often commanded Armies. He ſupported, by his Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Experience, for a long time, the Remains of a feeble and dying Party, againſt the Power of the King. He was illuſtrious by the Greatneſs of his Houſe; and his Religion was that of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> called <hi>the Reformed.</hi> His Body was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed, and afterwards brought to <hi>Geneva,</hi>

                  <p>Thou art, at Preſent, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where thou haſt all thy Heart can deſire; and I at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I have a thouſand Things to take Care for, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> are, indeed, two of the greateſt Cities in the World; but, much differing in manner of Living, Cloths, Language and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                  <p>The Philoſophy of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which I learned during my Captivity, gave me to underſtand, of what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How many things did we ſuffer in thoſe Days, whereat we do now laugh? Thou wert always chained; and I in Priſon, in a Den; thou wert beaten, becauſe thou wouldſt not read; and I was banged to pieces, becauſe I would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider.</p>
                  <p>The reading of <hi>Seneca,</hi> could not induce me to pardon my Maſter the Baſtinado's he gave me. That which I endured, was greater than the Pains which thou didſt ſuffer; I was perſecuted for the Pleaſure I took in Reading; and, they would oblige thee to ſtudy; whereas, thy Inclinations were quite different from mine.</p>
                  <p>This hardſhip made me reſolve to hide my ſelf in a Cellar, without Bread, and without Water. I had nothing but my <hi>Seneca</hi> with me; and I was reſolved to deliver my ſelf from my Servitude by Death; ſo far had this <hi>Stoick</hi> perſwaded me not to live. Thou art ſo near Death (quoth he) and in the mean time art a Slave. Judge the Force of my Temptation, by the Authority of this Great Man. Whilſt I was thus hid, my Maſter ſearched me in vain, in the Garden, the Stable, the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, and had no leſs Pains to find me, than I had to hide my ſelf from him. But, at length I choſe the better Part, which was, to live, and to forgive.</p>
                  <p>My Maſter owes his life to <hi>Seneca;</hi> he taught me ſo well, to forget Offences, that my Deſpair changed into Reſpect. I had no more Mind to die. I felt my Courage fail, and Fear made me pardon my Maſter. Thou hadſt no knowledge of this Adventure, becauſe I went into the Country, and thou waſt ranſomed, whilſt I was out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo.</hi> I was ſo very intent upon my Studies, that my Maſter, vanquiſhed by my Obſtinacy, gave me Liberty to apply my ſelf to them, being himſelf ſhamed to continue ignorant, whilſt I dreamt of nothing, but of improving my Mind.</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:46436:43"/>
                  <p>In the Courſe of four Years and four Months, that my Captivity laſted, <hi>Nero</hi>'s Maſter gave me the firſt Tincture of Morality; and after that, I went into the <hi>Academies,</hi> where I writ the <hi>Journal</hi> of my Life. <hi>Plutarch, Livy,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> made me forget the odious Names of <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Slave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Examples of ſo many great Men, whoſe Hiſtories we find there; of ſo many Emperors, Kings, Captains, Maſters or Slaves of their Paſſions; ſome dead by the hands of their Friends, by Poiſon; others by the Sword and Surprize; others perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by their Fathers or their Sons; ſometimes by their Wives, and often by their Native Country and Slaves, ſo often ſaved and defended by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; diſpoſed me to ſuffer patiently the ſtate whereunto I was reduced; and to acknowledge, That the honeſt Man is never a Slave, where ever he is, when he can find his Maſter within himſelf. I had time then to do a thouſand good Things, which I ſhould never have done, if I had not been in the Condition I then found my ſelf in.</p>
                  <p>Conſider how much we learn by Books, and more yet by the Diſgraces that happen to us. We ſee the Ill as in a Perſpective, and the Good in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Diſgraces afflict us when they happen, and good Fortune when it leaves us. When I was in my Houſe, I lived at reſt, becauſe I fanſied Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and now I am in Service, I am in continual fear of not Pleaſing. How many Souls hath <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> ſent into the <hi>other World,</hi> to expect the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Day of Judgment? and how many more will he ſend in this Siege of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whither he goes in Perſon, carrying Terror with him, and Forces ſufficient to deſtroy the Empire of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath commanded me to obſerve the Actions of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with all poſſible Application and Exactneſs, to give Information of them. He
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46436:43"/>will, in doubtful Affairs, have me to write to him my own Judgment, and not that of others. He will have me not to ſhorten, but extend my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that nothing may be left that will admit of a double Interpretation, and will rather have me tedious, than appear eloquent by the Conciſeneſs of my Relations. He orders me to receive the Advices of <hi>Carcoa,</hi> who is at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and to inform <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who reſides at <hi>Genoa,</hi> in what is neceſſary; to the end, that all that paſſes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> may be diſpatched to the Miniſters of the <hi>Divan.</hi>

                  <p>The Secretary of State, as Maſter of all that is written, has order to en-regiſter my Letters, and examine them. He, according to his Capriciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Ignorance, may render the Exactneſs wherewith I obey, criminal; by ſaying, <hi>I am a Fool,</hi> or <hi>do not write the Truth.</hi> This regiſtering puts me in Pain: for, as many mean Things may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very good at firſt Sight; and are often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, becauſe of their Novelty; ſo they may appear alſo very deſpicable, when they come to be examined; and may deſerve a Check.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee what I have reaſon to fear, without telling thee thoſe Things which might raiſe a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in thee, that I have reaſon to hope.</p>
                  <p>Our Soveraigns are Mighty, and they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves from all the Potentates of the World, by the Impetuouſneſs wherewith they give their Orders; and, there is no Empire, where the Puniſhments and Rewards work ſo great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Thou knoweſt the reſt, which is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to tell thee, and which Princes do not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear.</p>
                  <p>Explain to me better the News I heard of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuladdin Aga,</hi> of an Action of Juſtice of old <hi>Berber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He writ to me, That a Creditor to whom he owed for a Shirt, being dead, he had put the Price
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46436:44"/>into the deceaſed's Hand, and went his ways. This new way of paying Debts, ſeems very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to me. There is an Author, whether <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> I have forgot, which tells another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture not unlike this, of a Man who not finding his Shooe-maker alive, threw the Price of the Shooes he had made him into his Shop. If theſe Actions be not done for Oftentation, they ſeem vertuous; but if out of Vanity, I cannot believe, that our Negligence to pay our Creditors whilſt alive, can be excuſed by the Care we take to pay them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death.</p>
                  <p>The Dead want nothing in the <hi>other World;</hi> they are Living that have need of Supplies in this; and who ſuffer ſometimes very much, when they are not punctually paid. The <hi>Ancients</hi> could never ſufficiently deſcribe the Exceſs, which Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by their Paſſions; and the <hi>Moderns</hi> do it as little.

                  <p>MY laſt Letters ſhew what happen'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> on the Side of <hi>Piemont,</hi> which thou may'ſt have ſeen at the <hi>Divan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have informed the Council what the <hi>Infidels</hi> have done there; where three different Nations, which have but one Religion, fight together: The <hi>French</hi> make War upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Savoyards;</hi> and theſe latter would drive the other out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and reduce <hi>Savoy</hi> under their Power, which does what it can to avoid the Yoke of both theſe Nations.</p>
                  <p>It is to be feared, that new Troubles may ariſe from this War; which will undoubtedly happen, if it be not ſuddenly terminated by a Peace. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As their Eſtates are ſeparated the one from the other, ſo they are divided by their Maxims, their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and Pretenſions. They have, however, but one Religion, which they make to ſerve for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to their Deſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There are few that can ſuffer the Conqueſts of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> becauſe that Nation ſeems reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and Men would not ſee the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more powerful than they are; becauſe they play too

But however, as the leaſt of theſe Princes have their particular Inclinations and ſecret Intereſts with theſe two Nations, thou art ignorant of thoſe of the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom they have ſtrong Alliances: But peradventure thou haſt not been informed of a Conſpiracy, which appears to have been carried on in the City, to introduce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into it, which the <hi>Republick</hi> will in no wiſe ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Conſpiracy is thus related: The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Montercy</hi> having finiſhed the time of his Government of <hi>Naples,</hi> and being imbarked with ſome Galleys, for his Return into <hi>Spain,</hi> came <hi>incognito</hi> into <hi>Genoa;</hi> having had a Conference in a Village near the Town, with ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, to render himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Port,</hi> and afterwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Marquiſs of <hi>Leganez,</hi> Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> promiſed to ſend to <hi>Genoa</hi> a Chain of Slaves ſtronger and more numerous than ordinary, which, inſtead of conſiſting of condemned Criminals, was to be compoſed of the braveſt Officers of <hi>Milan;</hi> and ſome Nobles of the Acomplices, who were to ſhare in the Treaty, were to receive the Troops and come armed for effecting of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
                  <p>After a Deſign ſo well laid, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ready to execute ſo hard an Undertaking; when the <hi>Republick,</hi> being ſuddenly advertiſed of the Plot, cauſed it to miſcarry, without Noiſe, by redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Guards, which did not a little ſurprize the Conſpirators.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Creatures give out, That one <hi>Doria,</hi> called their Prince, did diſſuade, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Plot, which was profitable for <hi>Italy,</hi> but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46436:45"/>contrary to our Intereſts; for thence undoubtedly had ſprung a War which would never have had End, whether betwixt the Subjects of this <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> who would have ruined each other, or <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and thou wilt alſo find, that in preferring the Liberty of their Country, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at a Diſtance, they will maintain themſelves ſtill in a Condition advantageous for the Common-wealth, and neceſſary to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſay, That the Conſtancy of <hi>Doria,</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Honour of having twice ſaved the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Country.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Doria</hi> is deſcended from <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> that great Captain, who did ſo many brave Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt our Nation, commanding the Maritime Armies of <hi>Charles</hi> V. Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> and ſince, thoſe of <hi>Philip</hi> II. his Son, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and who often combated the Invincible <hi>Ariaden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not believe that <hi>Adonai,</hi> which was at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> hath writ this Adventure to thee; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may not be true, or becauſe the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Secret, it was in a manner ſtifled as ſoon as diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt know the particular reaſonings, made upon this Occaſion, I will tell thee, That the moſt adviſed <hi>French</hi> believe, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did attempt ſo fair a Blow; but that the two Parties in the City, the one to preſerve their Liberty, and the other to maintain their Authority, did both avoid the Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſe is, at Preſent, various, concerning this <hi>Republick;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> do as much endeavour to make ſecret Treaties with it, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to hinder its change of Maſter.

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> make a great Noiſe with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences upon <hi>Genoa;</hi> and they, at Preſent, revive many Ancient Hiſtories. They affirm, That the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> when they had Differences amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have often-times changed their Laws and their Maſters; and that they have been ſubjected to ſtrange Powers: That Two <hi>Charles's,</hi> One <hi>Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> I. all Kings of <hi>France,</hi> have taken them into their Protection, having alſo ſubdued them by Force of Arms. They add, That this <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> I. continued a great while to ſend them Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; and, that it was by the Valour and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Doria,</hi> that this <hi>Republick</hi> recovered its firſt Liberty.</p>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HEnry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Firſt Prince of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> marching by <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> came upon the Frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he beſieged <hi>Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> ſtrongly ſeated upon the brink of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. His Army is made up of Twelve Thouſand Foot, and Twelve Hundred Horſe. The two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have had ſeveral Encounters and Skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherein the Loſs and Gain have been equal on Land.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affairs go ſo ill at Sea, that thou wilt wonder at the great Loſſes they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there. The <hi>French</hi> have burnt Two Gallions upon the Stock, that were a making, and ſix o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intirely finiſhed, which had not been yet at Sea. They have further, taken Eleven great Ships, whereof Six were richly loaden for the <hi>Indies;</hi> beſides the Equipage and Munitions of War; with Two old Gallions that were of no great uſe. They further, took a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cannons, which lay upon the Shore, One hundred whereof were Braſs, all with the Arms of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If all this I write be true, as I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46436:47"/>it is; we may ſay that this Prize, where there were more than a Hundred and fifty Pieces of Ordnance, was no mean Purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay nothing of the great Quantity of Artillery, mounted upon the Ships and Gallions, for fear of troubling thee with the News of ſo great a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein the <hi>French</hi> gained ſo many Veſſels and ſuch great Riches, as will ſuffice to equip a great Fleet.</p>
                  <p>The Prince beſieges the Place and preſſes it, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> defend themſelves bravely; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uch Blood will be ſhed there.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> which theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> call the <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> was come thither with Sixty Sail, whereof Forty two are Men of War, and the reſt Attenders; with ſome Fireſhips filled with Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Matter, which inflames eaſily to burn the Enemies Ships where they can come at them, ſo that there is nothing wanting in the Armies by Sea or Land.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> makes more noiſe at preſent than the <hi>Pope;</hi> and, 'tis credible, that what he has done, will gain him great Favour with his King.</p>
                  <p>He has, with as much Courage, inveſted Fourteen Galleys and Four Frigats, which came from the Neighbouring Ports to the Relief of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> with Three thouſand natural <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He fought ſix Hours together with this new Army, which he entirely defeated, having burnt and ſunk all theſe Ships, except one Galley, which was ſtranded and rendered uſeleſs. The Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi> with Eight hundred Men, was blown up: which was no ſmall Misfortune to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who loſt, upon this Occaſion, a great number of Souldiers and Seamen: And, 'tis believed, they will not be able to appear before their Enemies in Sea this great while.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:46436:47"/>
                  <p>If ſo many Loſſes ſuffered by a Party, are not advantageous to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> becauſe the other is grown ſo much the ſtronger thereby, he will however gain this Benefit by it, That the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> being both Enemies to our Nation and Religion, our Affairs will be in greater Security, when of two Enemies we ſee one ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> publiſh by their Joy and continual Feaſtings, the Advantage they receive from theſe Succeſſes: And, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> have reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, their Victory having all the Agreements poſſible; it is indeed great, and their Loſs very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, there were but Twelve of the Ships of <hi>France</hi> diſordered, and that they loſt not above a Hundred Seamen, and very few Officers. Here hath been made a large Relation of this Victory; and, 'tis graved in Copper, to the end it may be made publick in all its particulars, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it conſerved to future Ages. Since the Loſs of the <hi>Armado,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>The Invincible,</hi> which <hi>Philip</hi> II. ſent into <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1588. to make War upon a Woman, we have not known that <hi>Spain</hi> ſuffered ſo great a Loſs.</p>
                  <p>This is the only News I can tell thee at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. So many Armies, as are in continual Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will furniſh Matter enough hereafter to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thee, by reciting the Follies of theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> who ſeem to deſtroy themſelves daily, and ruine their Affairs to gratifie Us by their Defeats, and make Us triumph.</p>

                  <p>THE King of <hi>France</hi> hath ſent forth another Army. I have already informed thee, that this Prince hath already Three Armies in Three Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> There is one in <hi>Piemont,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Cardinal la Valette;</hi> another whereof Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Condè</hi> is <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> which they hope will quickly take <hi>Fontarabia;</hi> and, a Third command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Marſhal <hi>Chatillion,</hi> which beſieges St. <hi>Omer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> is at the Head of the Fourth, which is entred into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ruine the <hi>French County,</hi> defended by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> one of the Emperor's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
                  <p>So many Armies, and ſo many Captains march againſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This Nation ſufficiently manifeſts her Force; ſhe is attack'd on all Sides, and reſiſts and defends her ſelf on all Sides. This vaſt Extent of Countries, which the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> poſſeſs, though ſeparated from each other, makes, that they are always employed in defending themſelves; but, they will be eternally expoſed to loſe without any Appearance of Gain.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt, that the true Secret of preſerving Union amongſt the Good, is to entertain perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Differences amongſt the Bad; and, thou wilt ſee, that all the Adventures of this Country will render Us Invincible. What I tell thee is a true Saying. The <hi>French,</hi> at Preſent, are too powerful, with ſo many Troops, ſo many Armies by Sea and Land, which are ſeen in the Provinces of their Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:46436:49"/>
                  <p>The other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are in continual Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Embaſſadors of Princes, which reſide in this Town and Court, obſerve with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſo many extraordinary Things, but ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; they do like me, they write and advertiſe their Maſters.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid thou wilt take no Pleaſure in the Relations I make thee of the Succeſſes of ſo great a Power, but I ought to let thee know the Truth. Affairs are carried on here with much Art. The Miniſters ſerve with great Fidelity, and are very ſecret. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> hath an entire Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over the King's Spirit; and, to ſay Truth, is a Perſon of great Merit. They ſay, he aſpires to true Glory, and will place the Crown, which <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> wore, as Emperor of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Head. If the good Fortune of <hi>France</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches always at this Rate, the Misfortunes of its Enemies muſt be exceſſive.</p>
                  <p>The manifold Wars which this Monarch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and <hi>Richlieu</hi> counſels him, do in the mean Time make the People (who bear the Burthen, by the Taxes which they are forced to pay) mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; beſides their Grief for the Loſs of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Friends, ſlain in theſe Wars.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> fears Peace, and apprehends his Enemies may deſtroy him, if they have leiſure to cabal againſt him. Thus he finds his Intereſt in the War, and the Armies ſupport his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>I cannot yet make any certain Judgment of him, nor have a perfect Knowledge of his Manners, no more than of the Extent of his <hi>Genius;</hi> becauſe, the Man hides many Things during his Life with a Dreſs, which will be diſcovered when he dies. We can ſee which are his good Inclinations; and it is not eaſie to penetrate into a Diſcovery of the Vices which he is inclined to.</p>

                  <p>The Court continues to make Vows for the Queen's Health, and happy Delivery. They ſeem not ſo much concerned for the King's Welfare, as the Queen's; every Body being perſwaded, That the Happineſs of <hi>France</hi> depends on her ſafe Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>

                  <p>There is News from <hi>Provence,</hi> of the arreſting of a King's Son, by that Governor. The Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is Brother to <hi>Uladiſlaus,</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had made Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in Recompence of the Troops of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> he had formerly raiſed to defend the County of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> They add, that being embark'd at <hi>Genoa,</hi> upon one of the Gallies of that <hi>Republick,</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſaid Charge, with a ſmall Train of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, and Count <hi>Konickpolski,</hi> who called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi>'s Embaſſador, with the Marquiſs of <hi>Gonzague,</hi> his Kinſman; being arrived in <hi>Provence,</hi> and viſiting with Care, all the Ports and Fortreſſes; this gave no ſmall Cauſe of Suſpicion to the <hi>French.</hi> He ſtaid four Days privately in <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> but, his Galley was arreſted at <hi>Bouc,</hi> the laſt Port of <hi>France,</hi> by Orders of this King.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not yet known, what obliged <hi>France</hi> to make a Perſon of this Quality, Priſoner, having nothing to do with <hi>Poland;</hi> and King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. having no particular Pique againſt Prince <hi>Caſimir:</hi> But, the Secrets of State being only known to them that govern Kingdoms, I pretend to penetrate no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but content my ſelf to write what they do, and what they ſay.

                  <p>The News here, is, That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was gone to make a Viſit to the King of <hi>Hungary;</hi> who, to do him Honour, ſent the chief of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to receive him upon the Confines of <hi>Moravia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They write alſo, That Arch-duke <hi>Leopold</hi> went from <hi>Vienna</hi> to meet him: They embraced like
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46436:51"/>Brethren; and returned together with the Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi> and her Siſter, back to Court. 'Tis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the People received this Company with great Acclamations, with the Noiſe of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and all the ſmall Shot of the City.</p>
                  <p>The Day following having dined in the <hi>Imperial</hi> Palace, they went together to <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> to viſit the Empreſs <hi>Eleanor,</hi> Widow to the late Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:46436:51"/>
                  <p>I am told, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> is gone with an Army, more numerous than all the Leaves on the Trees, to deſtroy the <note n="*" place="margin">Perſians.</note> 
                     <hi>Red-Heads,</hi> and conquer <hi>Babylon.</hi> I know that the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> and all the Grandees of the <hi>Divan</hi> followed him; but am ignorant of what he did in his firſt Expedition, when he took <hi>Revan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, who comes from <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan,</hi> and has ſerved in the Army of the faithful <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> paſſed this Way in his Return to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He hath been an Eye-witneſs of the great Actions of <hi>Amurath.</hi> He ſays, that this mighty Emperor after his taking of <hi>Revan,</hi> left Twelve thouſand Souldiers in Garriſon there, with Two hundred thouſand Crowns in Silver, beſides Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Moneys to pay them.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith alſo, that our mighty Monarch, being wearied to ſee ſo much Blood of the <hi>faithful,</hi> yea, of the Heretick <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> ſpilt, he had ſent the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> a Challenge; offering to fight ſingly in Duel with him, but he would not accept of his Defie.</p>
                  <p>He tells, how <hi>Amurath</hi> being fallen in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in paſſing the River <hi>Haret,</hi> was in great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being laid up in Expectation of the laſt Judgment Day, in the <hi>other World,</hi> had it not been for a Young luſty <hi>Solack,</hi> who took him by the Arm, and dragged him out of the River. This Accident was the Prelude of a great good Fortune, which happened to this mighty Prince upon the Bank of another River, called <hi>Mako,</hi> where he had the News of the Birth of a Son born to him in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom they call <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laaddin;</hi> whoſe Nativity hath been celebrated with infinite Demonſtrations of Joy.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man tells us further, that <hi>Amurath</hi> has taken <hi>Tauris,</hi> and appeared publickly there with all the Marks of a formidable Power; that he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46436:52"/>had deſtroyed the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> burnt the publick Markets, and cauſed a Million of fine Trees, which renders the Loſs irreparable, to be cut down.</p>
                  <p>Let me know, when thou art at leiſure, whether this News be true; and do me the Favour to tell me, our great Emperors Succeſs in the Expedition of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Politicians here, attend the News of it with much Impatience. 'Tis allow'd, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> is the moſt Potent of all Princes, the ſtrongeſt Man alive; and, that only he can vanquiſh and ruine the Kings of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Two Strangers of differing Nations, and both of <hi>Royal Blood,</hi> are dead in this City. The one is <hi>Don Chriſtopher,</hi> Son of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> who, after he had lived Sixty ſix Years, without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attaining the Crown of his Father, died in a <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Derviſes,</hi> called <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> where he was buried, in the ſame Place where his Father's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been formerly.</p>
                  <p>The other Stranger was called <hi>Zaga Chriſtos,</hi> who was the legitimate Succeſſor of the Kingdom of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia;</hi> a Young Man of Twenty five Years, Son to the Empreſs <hi>Nazarenne,</hi> Widow of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> who died in a Village near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> He quitted his Kingdom, as thou knoweſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Civil Wars; he arrived in <hi>France</hi> in the Year 1635. of the <hi>Aegyra</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> After many Adventures, he compoſed the Hiſtory of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, which he performed with Troubles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities which ſeemed inſupportable.</p>
                  <p>What has he not ſuffered in traverſing many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>Arabia</hi> the <hi>Deſart, Egypt, Aſia Minor,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where he ran the Hazard of being arreſted by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> that reſides there; whom he eſcaped by retiring by Night to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chriſtian Derviſes,</hi> where he concealed himſelf five Months?</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:46436:52"/>
                  <p>He ſaid here, that an Eunuch of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cairo,</hi> had much ſollicited him to forſake the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion, to which he would never conſent; and refuſed to go to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to humble himſelf, by proſtrating his Face in the Duſt of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Feet; although the <hi>Baſſa</hi> extreamly preſſed him to it, with very advantageous Offers.</p>
                  <p>This King has done much Honor to the <hi>Manes</hi> of the dead Prince, whilſt, perhaps, he ſuffers ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments; which neither thou nor I ſhall ſuffer, if we always live like faithful <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> according to the Precepts of the Law, ordained by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and written in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall gladly hear, that thy Life is ſafe, and my Friendſhip agreeable to thee.</p>

                  <p>THat which hath been ſo long expected, is at length happened: The Queen is brought to Bed of a <hi>Dauphin;</hi> the King is a Father; the Kingdom ſeems to deſire nothing more, and the People wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their Joy by a Thouſand differing Feſtivities.</p>
                  <p>The Men, the Women, the Children, and the Aged, run through the Streets as at <hi>Bacchanals.</hi> They rejoyce with their Friends, they go to Church. and thank <hi>God,</hi> as if a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> had been born to them.</p>

                  <p>All the Prieſts praiſe God in their Temples for ſuch a Preſent; and the <hi>Monks,</hi> not ſo content, deafen the People with the Noiſe of their Bells, and do more than the Drums and Trumpets of the Souldiers, and all the Cannon of the Cittadel and Arſenal. I did, in Company of others, what I ſhould not have dared to perform, if I had been alone, or had not been obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who affirmed, the Queen would be brought to Bed of a Son, pretend now, they had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by ſome Divine Revelation, and will paſs for Prophets; and, amongſt theſe, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Religious.</hi> Obſerve how far the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The <hi>Court</hi> has diſpatched many Expreſſes into all the Provinces of <hi>France;</hi> and, others have been ſent to all the Embaſſadors, to give Notice of this Birth to their reſpective Princes.</p>
                  <p>A Prieſt, who is a Biſhop, hath baptized this Child, without any Ceremony, in Preſence of the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> the Princes, Princeſſes, and Grandees of the Kingdom; the further Solemnity being reſerved for another time.</p>
                  <p>The King commanded <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſung; being the Hymn which is uſual to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to thank <hi>God</hi> for extraordinary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is ſeen in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> but Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, and Fountains of Wine, which run Day and Night. The People teſtifie their Joy; and the Fires are ſo great on all Sides, that it looks as if the City were to be reduced to Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt ſo many Subjects of Joy, the King has wherewith to afflict him, having been for ſome Days tormented with a violent <hi>Tertian Ague;</hi> and, it cannot be but he muſt have his Spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated with ſo many Wars at once. He has Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Italy, Burgundy,</hi>

Thou maiſt be confident, that Leagues will be formed againſt him, and Conſpiracies againſt his State. The Great Ones of the Kingdom are not aſleep; having long ſince had Deſigns to humble the Favourites and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe Deportments diſpleaſed them, and to make themſelves Maſters of Affairs, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

                  <p>They give the King the Title of <hi>Saint,</hi> which they add to that of <hi>Juſt,</hi> becauſe of his great Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in devoting his Son, before he was born, to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> (which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay is the Mother of their <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) with his Kingdom, People and Perſon, which he hath put under the Protection of the <hi>Mother</hi> of his <hi>God;</hi> which he has made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by Prayers, Proceſſions, and extraordinary Alms.</p>
                  <p>This Ceremony, is ordinary enough with theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> who, by an inexcuſable Idolatry, devote their Towns, and dedicate their Temples to Men that are dead, whom they call <hi>Saints;</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

                  <p>THE Birth of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> happened this Month, whereof I forthwith advertiſed the <hi>Kaimakam.</hi> I find my ſelf in a great City, where they feaſt continually, to teſtifie the Love they have for the King, the Queen, the Young Prince and the State.</p>
                  <p>Joy ſpreads equally; the moſt miſerable, to whom Fortune has given nothing but Tears, do now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Women rejoyce yet moſt; and, it ſeems, this Adventure regards them principally. There is not one of 'em that would not lie in; all the Maids would be Mothers, and the moſt advanced in Years do not now deſpair.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems here, that <hi>God</hi> only hears the Prayers of the <hi>French;</hi> for, they believe the Queen had never been with Child, if the People were not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus all believe, that they owe it to a Miracle of <hi>Heaven,</hi> not of <hi>Nature,</hi> that the Child is born; and for that reaſon he is called, <hi>Given of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be ſo, thou muſt conclude, this Prince will be very Great, and much to be redoubted, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46436:54"/>hath <hi>God</hi> for his Father, and is Heir of a great Kingdom. To ſay the truth, <hi>France</hi> was never ſo flouriſhing, beſides the great Armies they entertain by Sea and Land.</p>
                  <p>But, that which appears moſt important to me, is, their vanquiſhing the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and defeating the Rebels. The Birth of a Succeſſor, does much heighten theſe Advantages, and cauſes a great Happineſs to this Kingdom. I have my Share in the Feaſting, being obliged to do as others; for, to what purpoſe ſhould I appear afflicted?</p>
                  <p>Before I relate to thee a bloody Combat of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, which was fought in the Sea of <hi>Genoa,</hi> I will inform thee of a ludicrous one in that of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which reſembled thoſe Spectacles the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> exhibited with ſo much Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, called <hi>Naumachies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count of <hi>Alais,</hi> Governor of <hi>Provence,</hi> cauſed four Galleys, two againſt two, to combat, firſt with Cannon, and afterwards with Small Shot; and laſtly, to board with Swords and Pikes; which was a fatal Preſage for two Nations, who ran in ſearch of each other through all the Ocean, and exhibited a ſad Spectacle by Battles, where a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of valiant Men were ſeen to periſh.</p>
                  <p>Five and twenty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleys appeared on the Coaſts of <hi>Provence,</hi> where, it was ſaid, they were come to ſurprize ſome Maritime Place. But, the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Harcour,</hi> General of the Armies of the <hi>Levant,</hi> for the King, having given them Chace, ſome of them retired to the Coaſts of <hi>Genoa;</hi> where they were attacked by a like Number of thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> which had ſtill followed them ſince they were ſeen before <hi>Marſeilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the Firſt of this Month, that they fought. Never appeared more Valour; never was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat more terrible; and, 'tis ſcarce conceivable what Blood was ſhed. Thou, who art a great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46436:55"/>Captain, and an excellent Sea-man, mayſt gueſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thirty Galleys having began their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with their Cannon and Muskers, the Sea was in a little time coloúr'd with Blood, and covered with dead Bodies. Each Galley having ſingled out his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, the Fight was the more bloody and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. 'Tis ſaid, this Battel was ſeen from the Walls and Tops of Houſes in <hi>Genoa,</hi> which were crowded with Spectators; and looked on with the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as if they had fought for the Empire of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Victory coſt much Blood, which the <hi>French</hi> pretended to; ſeeing they took ſix Galleys from their Enemies, amongſt which was <hi>The Royal Patron</hi> of <hi>Spain, the Captain,</hi> and <hi>the Patron</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> with Eight hundred Priſoners; having themſelves loſt but three Galleys, which were taken by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> The following Night there aroſe ſo violent a Tempeſt, that the Sea had well-nigh ſwallowed the Victorious and the Vanquiſhed. The <hi>French</hi> loſt the <hi>Royal Patron</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> which breaking looſe, retired into a little Port of the River of <hi>Genoa;</hi> where the Inhabitants of <hi>Arenzano</hi> ſeizing it, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which, they ſay here, the <hi>French</hi> will not fail to revenge.</p>
                  <p>I am perſwaded, that all I write to thee is true, becauſe I have it from diſintereſted Hands, and ſuch as know the Truth of what paſſes.</p>
                  <p>They add only, that the Galleys of <hi>Spain,</hi> having more Slaves and Souldiers, the Victory of the <hi>French</hi> was by ſo much the more glorious; and they affirm, that the other had Two thouſand Foot extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, deſigned for <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> give thee always Victory over thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and make thee feared of all the World.</p>

We know well, that this Veſſel and her Loading are of good Value; but not ſo great as the <hi>Infidels</hi> publiſh. They ſay further, that they took upon the Coaſt of <hi>Calabria,</hi> two great Veſſels, and a <hi>Polagu,</hi> commanded by <hi>Bicoce,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> who is a <hi>Renegado</hi> of <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> They ſay, there were Two hundred <hi>Turks,</hi> Three hundred and fifty Priſoners taken, and Fifty <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves ſet at Liberty. If what they ſay is true, there were alſo a great many Braſs Cannon in theſe Ships. They confeſs, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of theſe Galleys, did all that was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Valiant Man, although he had the Gout, and that they loſt but Eight Knights.</p>
                  <p>Thou who knoweſt the truth of this Adventure, puniſh ſo great a Lye. 'Tis true, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have taken the Veſſels in Queſtion; but, it is not true, that their Advantage hath been ſo great as they make it, ſeeing there were no Braſs Cannon, but a few <hi>Chriſtians</hi> delivered; and, they having loſt much more than they acknowledge.</p>

                  <p>Thou art Valiant, thy Employment gives thee the command of the Sea; root out of the World this little Neſt of obſtinate Pyrates, who breath but by the Goodneſs of <hi>Amurath,</hi> whoſe Clemency hinders their Deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>WHY wilt thou be more cruel than a Serpent; and give me Poyſon, when I ſend thee ſo good Antidotes, to preſerve thee from the Miſchiefs, with which thou mayſt be over-whelmed? If thou beeſt not ſatisfied with me Friendſhip, be at leaſt wiſe with the Sincerity where with I have given my Advice. Thy proceeding, I muſt confeſs, makes me repent I did not takes another courſe; I ſhould thereby, in all Probability, have put a ſtop to all thy ill Practices. Had I made known to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> what I wrote to thee from <hi>Vienna,</hi> I ſhould have received Thanks for my Care and Diligence, and thy Chaſtiſement might have been of good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46436:57"/>But, I tell thee plainly now, that I ſhall be obliged to accuſe thee of Treaſon, in Caſe thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt thy Commerce with the Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>'s Secretary.</p>
                  <p>What Interpretation wouldſt thou have me give the Correſpondence thou holdeſt with this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; when I diſcover, that he ſends thee continually Preſents, and receives the ſame from thee? Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, every time thou appeareſt favourable to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the Pleaſures thou doſt them, render thee criminal to the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> For, in fine, what's the meaning of thoſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſes, thoſe <hi>Hungarian</hi> Slaves which thou ſenteſt, and that Quantity of Magnificent Veſts which thou preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt to thy Friend? What wouldſt thou have a Man think of that Silver <hi>Hercules,</hi> and Clock en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Pearls, which one of the <hi>Faithful</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from an Enemy of our Holy <hi>Law?</hi> It ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing to anſwer my Letters with Paſſion, and Raging: Go to the Tribunal, where theſe kind of Queſtions are to be decided; the Judge will tell thee, whether ſuch a Commerce is lawful, even in Times of Peace Thou much exaggerateſt the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations thou haſt to thy Friend at <hi>Vienna,</hi> becauſe he uſed thee well, when thou wert his Priſoner of War. To this it is eaſie to anſwer, That if he behaved himſelf like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> thou oughteſt to imitate him, like a good <hi>Mahometan.</hi> Should he happen to be thy Priſoner, take then thy Revenge, and endeavour to requite him.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſuppoſing it ſhould be diſcover'd, that this thy Friend has preſented thee with this famous Cypher, compoſed with ſuch Ingenuity, that it may be fitly called Arts <hi>Maſter-piece;</hi> what Opinion can the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have of thy Fidelity? 'Tis known with what Application thou uſeſt it to write into <hi>Germany,</hi> and to decypher the Anſwers which thou receiveſt. Are not theſe ſufficient Signs, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46436:57"/>ſhew, that the Diſpatches thou writeſt, and their Anſwers, are like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, concealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable and dangerous Myſteries? Be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I had not writ to thee from <hi>Germany,</hi> the Letter which has ſo greatly offended thee, on ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Conjectures. The Secretary, thy Friend, ſaid one day, he muſt be a Witch or a Devil that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Artifice of theſe Characters; That an <hi>Italian,</hi> who was condemned to perpetual Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, had wrought Twenty Years to meliorate this Art, and had brought it to ſuch great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that he never ſaw any body that could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Letters, with the Key it ſelf which he gave them. 'Tis ſaid, that this Invention is wholly new; and the more admirable, that a Letter of an ordinary Style, of Domeſtick Affairs, of Love and Complements, may contain Secrets of the greateſt Importance; without uſing equivocal Expreſſions, particular Characters, Figures, ſuppoſed Names, Hieroglyphicks, Juyce of Herbs or Liquors; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible ever to diſcover what one deſigns to hide. He adds, that one may write in <hi>Turkiſh, Arabian, French,</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> and conceal a Secret, written in any <hi>Tongue</hi> whatever.</p>
                  <p>Thy Friend carries it yet further, and ſays, he could make uſe of <hi>Verſes</hi> to decypher <hi>Proſe:</hi> And this audacious Man affirm'd, one Day, in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Anti-chamber, that he would put into <hi>French</hi> this horrible Blaſphemy, <hi>The Tyrant</hi> Amurath <hi>will ſoon die;</hi> which is found in the following Verſes of an <hi>Italian</hi> Poet, whereof he immediately made a Proof: And theſe are the <hi>Italian</hi> Verſes:</p>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>THE ſmall Succeſs which we always meet with at Sea, obliges me to entertain thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſhall take no Notice of this to the other Grandees of the <hi>Port,</hi> no not to the <hi>Kaimakam,</hi> to whom I have not written theſe Three Poſts. If thou haſt received my Two laſt Letters, thou oughteſt to be ſatisfied with the Care, which the faithful <hi>Mahmut</hi> takes to give thee ſound Advice. Conſider well all the Circumſtances, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated here, concerning the Sea-Affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Loſs of ſo many Galleys, great Ships, and other Veſſels, made this Year, by the Friends of the Empire, the <hi>True Faithful;</hi> do much leſſen the Reputation of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſes made hereon, by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are ſo many Invectives againſt the Honour of <hi>Amurath,</hi> againſt thine, and that of our Nation. If it be by a Decree of Heaven, that theſe <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Pyrates have taken, this Year, all the Galleys of <hi>Africk;</hi> we muſt then conclude, That <hi>God</hi> is offended with us, and does not hear our Prayers.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46436:58"/>For my part, I believe it; but I ſhould not be a good <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> ſhould I pretend to underſtand the Secrets of <hi>Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They write from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> That the People of <hi>Tunis, Bizerte,</hi> and <hi>Algiers,</hi> are greatly diſmay'd at the Loſs of their Fifteen Gallies, which General <hi>Capello</hi> has taken from them this Year. Thou knoweſt how the Buſineſs has happened; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the Treaty is manifeſt to all the World, as well as the Inſultings over the Fortreſs of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> I cannot imagine what Excuſes the Senators of this <hi>Republick</hi> can make, for what their Admiral has maliciouſly done againſt us, when they ſhall be obliged to give an Account of their Actions at the Fleet of <hi>Amurath.</hi> I ſpeak to thee with all poſſible Humility, and thou needeſt not doubt but I ſpeak with Zeal. I believe 'tis time for thee to oppoſe, and put a ſtop, not only to the Pyracies of theſe People, but the Incurſions and continual Enterprizes of the Corſaries of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and ſo many Veſſels which infeſt our Seas, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and other <hi>Infidel</hi> Princes. Thou oughteſt to ſuccour thoſe People which are Friends and Tributaries to the <hi>Port,</hi> whoſe Aſſiſtance thou haſt often advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed; neither doſt thou want means for this, having at thy diſpoſal the terrible Forces entruſted to thee by <hi>Amurath;</hi> and, with theſe, the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Courage given to thee by Nature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have vow'd to pierce, this Year, into the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and put all to Fire and Sword. Above Sixty <hi>French</hi> Knights are determined for <hi>Malta,</hi> to joyn themſelves with their Comrades, to cruiſe our Seas with them. And thou knoweſt the Reſolution and Courage of this <hi>Militia,</hi> and the Progreſs they every Day make.</p>
                  <p>Believe what <hi>Mahmut</hi> tells thee. Thou haſt Two Seas to keep; and if it be true, thou haſt made
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46436:59"/>
                     <hi>Ali Piccinino</hi> to come from <hi>Africk,</hi> with ſo many Galleys, deſigned to the keeping of the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary;</hi> 'tis not to be doubted, but the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> has ordered, (it concerning ſo greatly <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi>'s Honour) that the Guilty be purſued, ſo that not one of them may eſcape his Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>All People ſay here, that <hi>Piccinino</hi> has loſt his Army for want of good Conduct. However here are great Rejoycings at our Loſſes; and, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they feel the Advantage of ſo conſiderable a Prize at the ſame time, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Honour of the Victory; and where we are hated more than in any Place elſe beſides. I beſeech <hi>God</hi> to chaſtize theſe People by thy Hand; and that the Edge of thy Cymiter, in giving Death to our Enemies, may put an end to Slander and Slanderers.</p>
                  <p>Here's an impudent Fellow, who reports he has ſeen thee ſeveral times at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He, with great Confidence, affirms, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will bring thee one Day, laden with Chains, into the <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> or that of <hi>Malta.</hi> He grounds his Prediction on that thou art, ſays he, furious when thou commandeſt; and that being too forward, thou canſt not obey the Orders given thee. He adds, that <hi>Tobacco,</hi> Love of Boys, Wine, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omen drive thee twice a Day into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uncapable of exerciſing thy Reaſon. He moreover ſays, thou wanteſt Courage in a Land-Fight, neither art well skill'd in Sea-Combats. I would not write theſe Fooleries to thee, were I not perſwaded that they really are ſo; and that thou wanteſt neither Courage nor Experience. I am moreover perſwaded of the Malignity of thy Accuſers, touching the Debaucheries I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it appears to me more pertinent to write thee this, than to the <hi>Grand Vizir;</hi> though I muſt confeſs, I am enjoyned to inform the Miniſters of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46436:59"/>the <hi>Port</hi> of whatever I hear, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that as to what concerns the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Capello</hi> who commands its Navy, that this General will be puniſhed for doing too well; that this puiſſant <hi>State</hi> will be humbled to the kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Stirrup of our great Emperor's Horſe; but, it will juſtifie the Lawfulneſs of the Prize, which this <hi>General</hi> made, as being no breach of the Treaty with the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> whence come the Orders by which the World is to be governed; and that, in fine, the Pyrates of <hi>Africk</hi> are not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaties of Peace made with his <hi>Highneſs</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is moreover alledged, That ſhould this <hi>Republick</hi> be obliged to reſtore theſe Galleys which ſhe has taken, 'twill appear, they have been loſt through ſeveral Accidents.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> is perſwaded, there's no <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> in the World govern'd with greater Prudence; which will make her avoid all Occaſions of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the <hi>Port,</hi> and ſeek all Ways of Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Amurath,</hi> to prevent a War which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be for her Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>I happened into a Company of diſcreet Perſons, who blame <hi>Ali Piccinino</hi>'s Conduct; and attribute his Misfortune to his want of Skill, and to his Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They affirm, That had he had the Courage of a true Soldier, he would have behaved himſelf not only in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> but in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, like a Captain, and not like a Thief; and, that <hi>God</hi> has given him this Mortification, as a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Cruelty he ſhewed to the innocent <hi>Veſtals,</hi> whom he made Slaves at <hi>Calabria,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a great Multitude of Old Men, and Children; which was an Act no ways ſuitable to a brave Commander. And, this is the Diſcourſe, cauſed by the hatred to our Nation, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>Ali.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimakam.</head>
                  <p>THis Letter will perhaps prove troubleſome to thee, wherein thou wilt find an odd Mixture; however, thou wilt have no cauſe to complain of me; for, whatever I write to thee, ſhall be put into ſuch Order, that if the <hi>firſt</hi> News be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, the <hi>laſt</hi> will prove otherwiſe. Thou haſt received none of my Letters in the laſt Pacquets which I ſent thee; and, I have found it more to the Purpoſe, to make thee know at once, though ſomething later, what I could not write but at three times; whereby thou wilt be better informed than others, to whom I wrote the firſt Notices I had. There's nothing like to Patience; as in all other things, ſo more eſpecially as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns News; the lame Poſt always bringing the beſt Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>However, I hope thou wilt pardon me, if I wrote only to one Perſon, who is the Captain <hi>Baſſa,</hi> thoſe diſagreeable things which I heard, that I might not make a new Recital, which would not pleaſe; beſides, that he is obliged, as well as the other Miniſters of the <hi>Port,</hi> to impart to thee Advices he receives from me.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt find by the Copy of the Letter which I have written, that 'tis not without reaſon I am angry with him. My Deſign is not to learn thee, what thou kneweſt probably before me, but what thou maiſt be ignorant of, and yet oughteſt to know.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> expreſs continually their Hatred againſt us, always ſpeaking ill of our Affairs. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there he no War declared between theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:46436:62"/>and the ever Invincible <hi>Sultan;</hi> yet they ceaſe not to be our Enemies; and thou mayſt know by their Diſcourſe, they are ever laying Deſigns againſt us. Thow knoweſt, the uſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Way of the World is to diſcourſe firſt of Affairs, and then take their Reſolutions: The <hi>French</hi> are generally excepted from this Rule, for they have executed their Deſigns before they began to ſpeak of them; ſo lively is their Imagination, and ſo ready are they to take their Reſolutions. They do in Affairs of State, what we are wont to do in thoſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; they decide them by the Sword. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Princes who have Valour have no juſter Tribunal than War; and, that their Soldiers are their Lawyers. What Meaſures then, moſt wiſe <hi>Kaimakam,</hi> can be taken with a Nation which is in a continual Activity? The <hi>French</hi> cannot remain at Reſt; and when they diſturb not their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they make War amongſt themſelves. The Miniſters of Foreign Princes, who do, near the Matter, what I do; although they have a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which I have not, are inceſſantly in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They watch, without ceaſing, as I do, on what paſſes; and thou mayſt aſſure thy ſelf, that the <hi>Divan</hi> ſhall be fully and certainly advertized of all things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> keeps here, as his Ambaſſador, a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, called a <hi>Nuncio.</hi> The Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thoſe of <hi>England, Swedeland, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> the <hi>Electors,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of the <hi>Empire,</hi> entertain alſo Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, to obſerve the Motions of this Prince, who often breaks all their Meaſures. The States of <hi>Italy</hi> do alſo the ſame; there are, in this Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> Princes and <hi>Republicks:</hi> Theſe little Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, are more jealous than others, of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and, do more concern themſelves in all Affairs which paſs. The <hi>Republicks</hi> likewiſe uſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46436:62"/>greater Precautions in their Conduct, than the <hi>Monarchs</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> has acquired a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; <hi>France</hi> keeps a good Correſpondence with her; the Embaſſador of that <hi>State,</hi> living here with all the marks of Grandeur, and the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives granted to thoſe of Crowned Heads. Neither <hi>Perſia</hi> nor <hi>Moſcovia</hi> keep any <hi>Publick</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter here; yet, perhaps, they may have ſome that give <hi>Private</hi> Intelligence to their Maſters. As to what concerns the Princes of the <hi>Indies,</hi> they ſeem not to me, to have any Intereſt here; ſo that they have, I believe, no Agent in theſe Parts, either <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private.</hi> If the name of <hi>Spy</hi> be mean, or diſhonourable, I know no body that is called one; for I being unknown, my Reputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore runs no hazard. I ſerve, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But to ſpeak plainly, What are the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and Agents of Princes, but <hi>ſecret Spyes,</hi> as I am; who under pretence of keeping a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between their Maſters, inform them of what they can diſcover in the Courts, where they are ſent?</p>
                  <p>Thou ſhalt be ſufficiently inform'd by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, of <hi>Piccinino</hi>'s Adventure; he will ſhew thee what I have written. However, here are Sixty Galleys loſt; and our greateſt Conſolation is, that we ſhall not want means to be revenged: If the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have cut off one of our Fingers, we ought to pluck out both their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid here, that this <hi>Admiral</hi> is made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the <hi>Venetians;</hi> if this be true, his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be very uneaſie to him. But, all People are not agreed, whether he be a Priſoner or no; for, ſome maintain, he is at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he juſtifies himſelf, with his uſual Arrogance; laying all the Fault on the <hi>Renegado,</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>Algiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:46436:63"/>
                  <p>I have recommended to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, the Enterprize of <hi>Loretto.</hi> If thou haſt leiſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Project, thou wilt find, though I am no Captain nor Mariner, what I have hinted is worth regarding. The knowledge which I have of the World, of the Manner of living of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, and Prieſts of <hi>Rome;</hi> together with the other Notices I have required, by the reading of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, ſhould make me conſidered, as a Man that is able to offer at great Things; though I have not yet gained much Credit in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Embaſſador of <hi>Venice,</hi> reſiding in this Court, ſays, That their <hi>Republick</hi> will ſatisfie the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> affirming that <hi>Ali</hi> is a Pyrate; that the <hi>Africans</hi> have broken the Peace; and, that the Action of their General <hi>Capello,</hi> is juſt and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and, that <hi>Amurath</hi> himſelf will chaſtiſe <hi>Picci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino.</hi> He moreover pretends, that the Galleys which were taken, will not be reſtored, ſeeing it will be made apparent, they have been loſt by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Accidents: I think he ſays, they have been all ſunk before the Iſle of <hi>Corfou,</hi> by the <hi>Senate's</hi> Order, to prevent the Expectation of a Surrender, the <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>Algiers</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which thoſe <hi>Infidels</hi> have brought in Triumph into their <hi>Arſenal,</hi> to preſerve the Remembrance of an Event, which they pretend to be very glorious to them; but theſe Misfortunes are not extream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor paſt Remedy, if <hi>God</hi> continues the Life of our Great Emperor, and thy Health.</p>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>THey have at length given over talking of our Loſſes, but I give not over deviſing the means to be revenged of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Remember, that the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> keeps in Priſon a Man fit for great Things at this Time, who can do the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Miſchiefs, and procure notable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>Muſſulmen.</hi> If the old <hi>Renegado</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> be yet alive, he is capable of deſtroying all Places in the <hi>Mediterranean-Sea.</hi> Adviſe with him about the Deſtruction of <hi>Lorerio.</hi> There is no <hi>Corſary,</hi> that has done more bold Exploits. He has ſpent Sixty Years in courſing on the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi> and <hi>Adriatick-Sea;</hi> where he has made horrid Devaſtations, with infinite Prizes. He has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, moſt conſiderably damnified the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> on the <hi>Black-Sea.</hi> He began the Trade at Nine Years old, in a little Veſſel; has been wounded in Twenty, or Twenty two Oceaſions, taken Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Four times by our Pyrates, and thrice eſcaped out of their Hands. And not being able to fly the Fourth time, nor redeem himſelf by Money, he redeem'd himſelf by his Religion, which he quitted to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Ours; and ſince he has been Circumcized, he has brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> above Thirteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Slaves in about Thirty Years Space. He has paſs'd full Five Years in the Cleft of a Rock, along the Banks of the <hi>Adriatick-Sea;</hi> which by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry he made a ſure Place of Retreat. Here 'twas, that he did himſelf, with his Men and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, like a wild Beaſt in his Den; and 'tis hard to imagine how many Snares he laid during that Time, for thoſe of his own Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He has been
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46436:64"/>often purſued, but could never be taken; and his Name became ſo terrible amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that there was no Place but dreaded him. But, in fine, having, as 'tis ſaid, attempted to betray his Maſter, in delivering into the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Hands, the five Galleys he commanded; he was ſent, by Order from the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> into the Caſtle of <hi>Seven Towers,</hi> although his Crime was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly proved. 'Tis above Two and fifty Moons ſince he has been there kept Priſoner; and, he is not onely very old, but decrepid. The long Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which a Man has undergone, that has done ſuch <hi>great</hi> Things, and who is accuſed of having done <hi>one ill</hi> one, of which he is not convicted, does plead for ſome Indulgence.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall never go about to ſolicit for the Liberty of a Traytor; yet I muſt ſay, That Men who have dared to execute great Crimes, are often capable of Heroick Actions. This Man was, and is ſtill, at the end of his Life; perhaps if thou wilt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure him ſome Advantage, and make him hope ſtill greater, he may repair his Fault, by performing ſomething for the good of the <hi>Empire;</hi> or at leaſt, give ſome good Advice. Thou knoweſt, the <hi>Ancient Perſians</hi> had a Law, whereby their Kings were obliged, <hi>Not to put a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor to death for one Crime; and private Perſons, not to chaſtiſe their Domeſticks or Slaves for one Fault.</hi> Thou knoweſt, moreover, that Princes ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeve in the Chaſtiſement of their Subjects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Services they had rendred, have not been greater than their preſent Failings, and pardon them if their <hi>good</hi> Deeds ſurpaſſed their <hi>bad.</hi> Theſe Laws, although no longer obſerved in <hi>Perſia,</hi> yet ceaſe not to be wiſe Precepts; to which, if thou haſt no regard, yet thou wilt have ſome to the Zeal and Affection of <hi>Mahmut:</hi> And if thou wilt ſuffer me to make here a ſhort Digreſſion, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46436:64"/>the State wherein we are, with that of the Ancients; thou wilt find, how much our <hi>Monarchy</hi> ſurpaſſes all others. Doſt thou believe, Generous <hi>Kaimakam,</hi> that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire is equal, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, or ſuperior to that of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s time? Let us content our ſelves with ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it equal, to ſpeak without Paſſion, and cut the Courſe of Diſputes, which might be made hereupon; and reflect, I pray thee, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which <hi>Pompey</hi> held in the War he made againſt thoſe infinite Number of Pyrates, which infeſted the Seas of <hi>Italy, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> He was made <hi>General</hi> of an Army of Five hundred Sail, with abſolute Power to do what he thought ſitting, without giving any Account. Thou knoweſt his Conduct was ſo prudent, and full of Valour, that embarking with Ten thouſand and twenty Foot, and Six thouſand Horſe, he in Forty days cleared <hi>Libia, Sicily, Spain, Sardinia;</hi> and, in a word, all the Seas which depended on the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, from an infinite Number of Pyrates; who had, as it were, beſieged the Capital of the Empire, by their Incurſions, Rapines and Violences.</p>
                  <p>Now, although the Number of our Enemies be not ſo great, nor their Strength ſo conſiderable; yet 'tis to be feared, leſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> be one Day bold enough, (having joyned their Forces, which now lie diſperſed,) to fall upon us, and ſhake the vaſt Monarchy of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> which they now often diſturb by frequent Enterprizes in ſeveral Parts:</p>
                  <p>We have an infinite Number of Places to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. We have ſeveral Kingdoms, populous Iſles: we command war-like Nations, and the Number of the Empire's Subjects are innumerable, which ought to encourage us to undertake no leſs than <hi>Pompey</hi> did heretofore, who was called the <hi>Agamenon</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe he commanded a numerous Fleet, as this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46436:65"/>
                     <hi>Hero</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> formerly did. But, it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Midnight, I am forced to finiſh this Letter, leſt it ſhould be too late for the Poſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall inform thee by the firſt Opportunity of what has happened in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and of ſeveral other things which I thought I ought to give thee Notice of by this <hi>Expreſs;</hi> but, accuſe me, not of neglect, in not having wrtiten all to thee in this Letter, and receive my Excuſe, which is juſt and ſincere, and grant me thy Favor.</p>

                  <p>I Paſs immediately into <hi>Montferrat</hi> without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>France,</hi> to tell thee, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have there made themſelves Maſters of a little Town, which the <hi>French</hi> could not keep for want of Men; and have alſo demoliſhed the Fortreſs which guarded the Place, that their Enemies might not have any deſire after a Repriſal.</p>
                  <p>The eldeſt Son of <hi>Amadaeus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> is now dead; he was called <hi>Lewis Amadaeus:</hi> he was but Seven Years old when declared Sovereign, and was ſo but few Moons. He died Four days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ceremony of his Baptiſm. The King of <hi>France</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> were God-father and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46436:65"/>God-mother to this Prince. Thou wilt ask me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, how this could be, ſeeing they could not be there preſent? But thou muſt know, that theſe <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> aſſiſt often at theſe Ceremonies by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation. The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſeems to me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Compaſſion having loſt in one Year, both her Husband and her Son, and a good part of her Eſtate, and ſees what remains to her, expoſed to the Hazards of War; but ſhe has ever ſhewed her ſelf a Woman of Courage and Reſolution. Her ſecond Son has been declared his Brother's Heir, and the <hi>States</hi> have choſen her Regent, during his Minority.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the ſudden Viſit, which the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> gave the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> is not yet known: We have had Advice of his Departure from <hi>Dreſden,</hi> the Capital Town of his Country, with a great Train of Courtiers, and the Three Princes his Sons; and that he went to <hi>Leutmaritz,</hi> where this King expected him; and 'tis farther ſaid, That in the ſmall Time they were together, they have had ſeveral Conferences, the Subject of which is not yet diſcovered. The King has preſented the Duke with a rich Coach, with ſix ſtately Horſes, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly harneſſed; and given Diamonds and Gold Chains to his Courtiers. But thou being nearer the Place of this Conference, and the <hi>Port</hi> having every where ſubtle Agents, thou mayeſt ſooner get this Secret than I: For 'tis not to be doubted, but there's ſomething hatching againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, whilſt <hi>Amurath</hi> is at that Diſtance, and the chief Forces of his Empire employed elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the Progreſs of the Duke of <hi>Wimar,</hi> who carryes on the War in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> there are infinitely different News come from thence, ſince I wrote to thee, but, this is what is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, After the taking of <hi>Fribourgh,</hi> this General made himſelf Maſter of the Campaign about <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac;</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:46436:66"/>and his Army ſeizing on all the Poſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> put themſelves in a Poſture of hindring them; but for three Months Time, they could do nothing but ſpoil the Corn, and forrage in the Country, whereby they waſted their own Subſiſtance. They have alſo fruitleſly endeavoured to break down the Bridge, which <hi>Wimer</hi> had built at <hi>Newremberg;</hi> where they met with ſuch Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that they were forced to retire with their Army, which was in great Danger. But the Duke alſo met with no Succeſs in his Enterprize on <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>femburgh,</hi> through the Fault of Fifteen hundred Musketeers, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> who came not ſoon enough to plant their Ladders againſt the Walls, and ſurprize this Place; and, he has ſince made different Tryals, which have proved all in vain. An Officer had already entered as far as the Ramparts, with a ſmall Party which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by means of a falſe Paſs-port; but, being diſcovered by a Sentinel, he was forced to retreat in Confuſion, with the Loſs of ſome of his Men, <hi>Wimar</hi> ſince defeated two Regiments of <hi>Dragoons.</hi> and Two other Regiments of Horſe, and ſiezed on the Caſtle of <hi>Mauberg</hi> the Garriſon of which Place ſurrendred at Diſcretion, to a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.

                  <p>The <hi>Emperor's</hi> Troops being diſcovered by <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar's</hi> Vant-guard, commanded by <hi>Turenne,</hi> gained an high Ground; on which, fortifying themſelves, they ſheltred behind a Church and ſome Houſes, before which there was a Battery raiſed of ſeveral Pieces of Cannon, to keep the <hi>Swedes</hi> at a Diſtance and hinder them from encamping too near. Some <hi>Franch,</hi> imprudently advancing to diſcover the Enemy's Poſture, within leſs than Musket-ſhot,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46436:66"/>were almoſt all kill'd on the Place. By this time the Duke of <hi>Wimar,</hi> ſeeing he could not draw the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to fight, and it being impoſſible to force them on the Mountain, where they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, retired under the Caſtle of <hi>Mauberg,</hi> with his Rear-guard, commanded by the Count <hi>de Gurbian,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, The next Day he joined the reſt of his Army, and being informed by a <hi>Moor</hi> that ſerved him, and in whom he put great Confidence; that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> began early in the Morning to retire; he immediately therefore put himſelf into a Condition to follow them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Army to march in Battle-Array: His Horſe conſiſted of Twenty four Squadrons, and his Foot of Eight Batalions; beſides the Auxiliary Troops, of which he made a Reſerved Body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> affirm, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were the ſtrongeſt, as having Four thouſand Men more than the <hi>Swedes;</hi> of which, 'tis hard to know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; but, the Particulars of the Battle, are worth ones writing. 'Twas very bloody, the Fight being obſtinately held by both Parties, and the Victory long inclining, ſometimes to one ſide, and ſometimes to another: So that the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were ready to retire, weary of ſtriking, and being ſtruck; when Fortune on a ſudden, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her ſelf for the Duke of <hi>Wimar,</hi> who behaved himſelf in the Fight, like a wiſe Captain and valiant Soldier. 'Tis certain, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> have loſt Two thouſand Men in this Occaſion, with ſeveral of their principal Officers: And alſo above Fifteen hundred were made Priſoners, amongſt which there were above Two hundred Perſons conſiderable on the account of their Birth or Employs. I make no mention of the Number of the Cannon; neither do I reckon the Hundred Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or Cornets, nor Three thouſand Waggons laden with all Sorts of Ammunition, which fell
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46436:67"/>to the Conquerors; but, I greatly value the Box of Writings of two great Commanders, wherein were found the Inſtructions and ſecret Orders of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſome Treaties made with the <hi>ſublime Port:</hi> to which all the Potentates of the World ſhould pay Homage.</p>
                  <p>It cannot yet be diſcovered what theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contain, yet I ſhall do all that's poſſible in order to it. The booty has been great, however <hi>Wimar</hi> ſeems not to ſet much by it, as aiming at ſomething more conſiderable. He remained two Days in the Field of Battle, the better to aſſure his Enemy of his Conqueſt: he moreover pretends in his Letters to this Court, that he had not in this Expedition above Five hundred Foot, and few Cavalry; which out of a Bravado, he ſays he will reinforce with his Pages. This is that which our Emperors, who are the Maſters of the World, would ſcruple to ſay in the Preſence of their Slaves; ſo far would they be from ſpeaking ſo, before an Army, as this Prince did, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a great King. See the Vanity of one of theſe <hi>Infidels's</hi> Generals.</p>
                  <p>In Obedience to the Orders which I received from thee, I here end my Letter; ſo that thou wilt receive a very imperfect Relation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which I began to relate to thee; and I ſhall continue my Diſpatch to Morrow, that thou maiſt the better remember what I have already written to thee, that I may not loſe the Thread of the Hiſtory.</p>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>I Find in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> which ſpeaks of <hi>Limbo's,</hi> to be very long; and, I believe I never wrote thee any Letter, wherein there were ſo many Words: Thou ſhalt not receive henceforward any from me larger than the Hundred and ſix Verſicles of this Chapter, ſeeing thou enjoyneſt me to be ſhort. I have therefore divided this Diſpatch into two, leſt it ſhould prove tireſome to thee; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I believe thou wouldeſt have found it when entire, not ſo long as the <hi>Chapter</hi> which treats of <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wimar</hi> loſt no time, but went and encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Brizac;</hi> he cauſed the Trenches to be opened with great Diligence, and has ſo beſet the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that nothing can paſs without his Leave. This River is conſiderable for its Largeneſs, and Length of its Courſe; carrying Veſſels of great Burthen, which makes it much frequented.</p>
                  <p>This Captain having diſcovered the Town wanted Proviſions of all kinds, uſed all imaginable Artifices to ſurprize it, or carry it away by Aſſault. It is the Capital of a great Province, where he is Maſter of ſeveral conſiderable Places, and ſeveral ſtrong Caſtles, from whence, one may ſay, the Place was already beſieged.</p>
                  <p>Things were in this Condition, and there was no other Diſcourſe in the <hi>Swedes</hi> Camp, but of Victories, Loſſes, and Wounds, when the News of the Birth of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was brought there, which cauſed another Noiſe to be heard. The Horſe and Foot, joyned their Shouts of Joy to the Sounds
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46436:68"/>of the Drums, Trumpets, and the Artillery, which was ſeveral Times diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>The Valour of the Duke of <hi>Wimar,</hi> and that of the Troops which he commands, made not the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> to loſe their Courage; having recruited their Army with new Troops. General <hi>Lambore,</hi> a Man of Courage, and good Conduct, appeared in the ſight of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> having added to his Army Five Thouſand Men, with the reſt of the Troops of Prince <hi>Savelly,</hi> and waſted the Country which the Enemy was in poſſeſſion of. If thou wouldeſt know the Situation of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Camp, and, in what manner they made their Trenches, and Circumvallations, I can certainly inform thee; having had ſome time ſince a very exact Draught of it. This Camp is Three <hi>German</hi> Miles in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; fortified on each ſide by a Trench Sixteen Foot thick, with a large deep Ditch, a double <hi>Paliſado,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Redoubts.</hi> The lower as well as upper Parts of the Town, are mightily annoyed by Two Bridges made on the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Abundance of all ſorts of Ammunition, does much hearten the Army. The Commander, although very ill, yet is inceſſantly watchful, and ſeems indefatigable. The Soldiers animated by their paſt Succeſſes, think of nothing but new Conqueſts, and new Booty, imagining themſelves invincible. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery which is in the Camp, is Fifty Pieces of great Cannon, with which ſuch Batteries have been made, as drive the Beſieged to deſpair. I mention not to thee ſeveral ſmall Skirmiſhes, which continually happen; yet this is what is moſt conſiderable: Some Troops of young Soldiers of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, having taken ſeveral Cattle from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and made ſome Priſoners, had notice of the March of Colonel <hi>Sillard,</hi> who came from <hi>France,</hi> and brought a good Summ of Money for the Payment of the Troops. They went to meet him, and took
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46436:68"/>it, together with ſeveral young. Gentlemen Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, all Men of Note; and, who had alſo a great deal of Money about them. At the ſame time, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a Prince of great Valour, who ſerves in the <hi>Imperialiſt</hi>'s Party, has undertaken to relieve <hi>Brizac,</hi> which he knew was reduced to the utmoſt Extremity; and, having choſen, for this Deſign, Forty Companies of Foot for a Convoy of Proviſions; and, being on his March, he met with the Duke of <hi>Wimar.</hi> And this is the ſhort of the Story: The Prince was ſtill indiſpoſed, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his late Sickneſs; yet, this could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from embracing this Occaſion, which he believed to be of great Importance to his Party; he got therefore on horſeback, and marched up to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>The Combat laſted Five Hours, and <hi>Lorrain</hi> did all that could be expected from a brave and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Commander. But, he was conſtrained to yield to the Duke's Fortune, and retire into a wood, with what he could ſave of his Troops; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> Courage was not a little increaſed by ſo great an Advantage, which will certainly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the Surrender of <hi>Brizac.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Wimar</hi> remained Maſter of the Field, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeated the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> Foot, and put the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Horſe into a horrid Diſorder: There lay above Twelve Hundred dead on the Place, and all the Baggage, together with the Ammunition, fell into the Hands of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. A Man would think, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimakam,</hi> that the God <hi>Mars</hi> has united himſelf with this Captain: for, notwithſtanding the Weakneſs of his Body, he performs every Day moſt Heroick Actions, with his valiant Soldiers, who are ready to undertake any Thing, when he is at their Head. Whether this happens from his not valuing of Life, or his Thirſt after Honour; yet, ſo it is, That
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46436:69"/>That he cannot live without nouriſhing himſelf with Victories; and, he begins already to equal the famous <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> under whom he has learn'd his Trade. Yet he has loſt, notwithſtanding his Diligence, Two Forts he built on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> which, if he retakes, 'twill not be without the Coſt of much Blood on both Sides. The <hi>Germans</hi> have already loſt Sixty Thouſand Men there, amongſt which there were Four Hundred drowned.</p>
                  <p>The Extremities of <hi>Brizac,</hi> of which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready private Advices, is at preſent known by all the World. The <hi>Swedes</hi> intercepted, the laſt Moon of <hi>October,</hi> a Letter from the Governor to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> wherein he laid open his Condition, and told him plainly, That Places which wanted Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended but by a Miracle; adding. That the beſt Officers and Soldiers were already dead; and thoſe that were alive were either ſick, or lay wounded, and ſo greatly tired, that they could do no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and beſides, their Victuals would laſt but Twelve Days. He ſeemed afterwards to reproach him for letting the Time ſlip, in which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him Aſſiſtance; and put him in mind, he did not believe he could hold out to the 4th. of the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>September;</hi> being reduced to ſuch Extremities, that he durſt not mention Particulars, leſt his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould fall into other Hands. Obſerve the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of the Expreſſions; he dares not write all, and yet he writes more than needs, to diſcover, that the Place will be infallibly taken.</p>
                  <p>If thou beeſt impatient to know the Surrender of <hi>Brizar,</hi> thou ſhalt be ſatisfied by this <hi>Diſpateh.</hi> The Poſt is now come, which brings News of the taking of this important Place, and he has come hither in Three Days. The Place was taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of War, ſurrendring the Ninth of the laſt <hi>Moon</hi> of this Year, according to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46436:69"/>
                     <hi>Christians</hi> Style. The Governor procured very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Terms; and truly, he ſuſtained the Siege, with all the Vigor and Courage poſſible, to the laſt Extremity. He is called the Baron <hi>de Reynech:</hi> His Name deſerves a Place in the Letters thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regiſters; and, that the <hi>Divan</hi> ſhould be informed of a Man, who knows ſo well to defend what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to him, that they may give to Vertue her Due. There went out of <hi>Brizac,</hi> only Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, and Seventy Horſe, who were all naked, wounded, and almoſt dead with Hunger; they were reduced to thoſe Extremities, that they had already eaten the Fleſh of Horſes, Cats, and Dogs; and ſome were ſaid to have devoured humane Fleſh. As touching the Booty, there are different Diſcourſes; but, 'tis certain, the Conqueror found above Two Hundred Pieces of Cannon in the Place.</p>
                  <p>But, there is a ſtrange Story related of a young Lady, of admirable Beauty, who falling down at the Duke of <hi>Wimar</hi>'s Feet, thus ſpake to him: <hi>Sir, I have but ſome few moments to live, Hunger having reduced me to the Gates of Death; but I ſhall die deſperate, if you do not revenge me of a baſe Fellow, who has exacted of me a Diamond of great Value, which I have been forced to give him for a roaſted Mouſe;</hi> I <hi>am not angry with him for his taking of me a Pearl-Necklace during the Siege, for Four Ounces of Flower; but, I confeſs my Weakneſs, I cannot fee my ſelf berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of what I moſt valued, and die without Satisfaction.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, this Prince could not forbear ſhedding Tears at ſo piteous a Spectacle; this Lady dying almoſt at the ſame Inſtant ſhe had done ſpeaking; but, 'tis not known, whether he called this hard-hearted Fellow to an Account, for what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>The Siege of <hi>Brizac</hi> laſted Four Months; almoſt Fourſcore Thouſand Men periſhing in the Town,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46436:70"/>by Sickneſs, Wounds, and Famine. Bonfires are made at <hi>Paris,</hi> for ſo great an Advantage; and, the Duke of <hi>Wimar</hi>'s Praiſes, are every where celebrated; and great Commendations are given him in the Letters from the Court. Our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may have one Day ſomething to fear, from ſo brave, ſo experienced, and ambitious a Captain, were he at leiſure. But, <hi>Germany</hi> is ſo large a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo full of ſtout Men, and contains ſo many great Towns, and thoſe ſo well fortified, as will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him Work enough, without troubling Us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis pleaſantly ſaid here, That the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> will no more ſleep quietly, for, in loſing <hi>Brizac,</hi> they have loſt their Pillow on which they reſted, and, 'tis thought, <hi>France</hi> may one Day unite this Conqueſt to her Crown. The great <hi>God</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Years of thy Life, as the Sand of the Sea; and increaſe every Day thy Fortune, and continue thy Health.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46436:70"/>will be more deformed than he was, having now left his Noſe and Ears in the Hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executioner. <hi>Amurath,</hi> in condemning him to this Puniſhment, has done an Act of Juſtice worthy of him: For, the honeſteſt Men in the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> have ever wiſhed Ill to this proud and inſolent <hi>Greek.</hi> This Man, who was but a pitiful Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Seller of Oyſters, got this intolerable Pride by the prodigious Riches he acquired in this mean Occupation. His great Wealth, made him find the Means of obtaining the Favour of the Miniſters and Favourites of the Prince; and <hi>his Highneſs</hi> himſelf honoured him with his Friendſhip, gave him Offices and heap'd up Riches on him.

                  <p>The News of the Fall of this Slave, had in ſome ſort mitigated the great Melancholy I felt, when I received the Letter: But, the Death of <hi>Zagaribaſci,</hi> our common Friend, does not a little afflict me; as well as the Marriage of his Son <hi>Caragurli,</hi> made the ſame Day, does aſtoniſh me: For, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, how there could well be celebrated in the ſame Day, and at the ſame Houſe, two ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46436:71"/>Ceremonies, as is a Funeral and a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>I find this Adventure very ſtrange: and though our Friend indeed was very old; yet I bewail him, as if he had dyed before his Time. He was an honeſt Man, of great Piety, and moderately Rich; and, this is what makes Mortals Happy in this World, and the other too. But, thou doſt not inform me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the exceſſive Joy he had, to ſee his Son married to a <hi>Greek,</hi> rich with the Goods of Fortune, endued with great Vertue, and a <hi>Mute,</hi> has not cauſed his Death. I rather think thou wilt ſay, our Friend <hi>Zagarabaſci</hi> is dead by ſome Exceſs, than yield to what we conteſted about formerly. I always found in this Friend great Marks of Honeſty and Sobriety; and he alſo appeared to me, to have great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for his Son. I cannot, without offending thee, accuſe this old Gentleman of want of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet he is dead with a Tranſport of Joy. Thou ſeeſt, I affirm'd no impoſſible thing, when I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in my Youth, That an extraordinary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen Joy, is more likely to kill, than ſudden Grief, though never ſo violent. Didſt thou think it a Matter of ſmall Satisfaction, to a Father, that is a wiſe and ſober Man, to obtain for his Son a Woman that is a <hi>Mure?</hi> For, what greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure can a Husband have, than to have a Wife that is not talkative? The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> underſtand not the Wiſdom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they laugh at our <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> who find the greateſt parts of their Pleaſures, in the Converſation of <hi>Mutes.</hi> Is there any thing more delightful, than to <hi>hear</hi> a Man, that does not <hi>ſpeak;</hi> and to ſee one reaſon on all Things, that has no Tongue? Thou knoweſt how many Things theſe <hi>Mutes</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> do give one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; and what Eloquence there is in their Signs and Geſtures. Thou remembreſt, That when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> would give Thanks to the Sovereign Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46436:71"/>of all the World, in that he had eſcaped Death, when the Lightning fell on his Bed, and burnt to his very Shirt; he ſeemed to offer him a great Sacrifice, in putting a <hi>Mute</hi> out of the <hi>Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> which he dearly loved by reaſon of her Tricks and Geſtures. The <hi>Muſes</hi> were one day ready to fall together a fighting, becauſe they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive amongſt them a Tenth Companion, ſent them by a <hi>Mandamus</hi> from a King of <hi>Italy:</hi> But when this Tenth <hi>Muſe</hi> ſignified to them, <hi>That ſhe was Dumb,</hi> all the Voices were for her. Dear <hi>Melec,</hi> 'tis not without Reaſon I write thee this. Thou art ſtill young, and deſigneſt for Matrimony: Believe <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut;</hi> There are few Women that are Wiſe; and they ſay little that is good: Think then what thoſe ſay, who know nothing, and whoſe Number is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. When they have talked a whole Day, believe me, they have ſaid nothing. If thou marrieſt, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my Counſel: <hi>Take not a</hi> Mute; <hi>for then thou wilt marry a</hi> Beaſt: <hi>Neither chuſe one that talketh; for, thou wilt be linked with a</hi> Monſter. As to our Friend, he died by a particular Grace from Heaven: Yet I cannot but think ſtill of his Death. How many more extraordinary Accidents wilt thou ſee, if thou liveſt to old Age; and eſpecially, if thou liveſt at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where are continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſtrange Adventures, and extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, both of Life and Death, Cruelty and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; as well as of good and bad Fortune? Being in breath, I could continue ſtill to write to thee; but, I think it's time to end, leſt I prove tireſome. And I end, in praying Heaven to keep thee in Health, where-ever thou art.</p>

                     <hi>PARIS,</hi> where I live, is a very healthful City, and ſo are all the Places thereabouts, free from Peſtilential Airs; and yet there oft happens ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Deaths, as well as at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and, they die here likewiſe of Joy. I will relate to thee what I have partly ſeen, and not what I have heard, to happen in <hi>London,</hi> the moſt ancient, and chiefeſt City of the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> A rich old Man falling ſick, and lying on his Death-Bed, ſent to his only Son, living at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he ſpent his time in Pleaſures, to come over, that he might, with his Eſtate, give him his Bleſſing. Think what News this was to a Young Man, to whom the Life of a Father was troubleſome, as being an Obſtacle to his Liberty; and, who waited his Death, to take his Swing of all the Pleaſures, which his corrupt Nature makes him reſpect as his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Good. This Young Man intending to get upon Horſeback, to run where he was called, found himſelf embarked for a Voyage, which he did not deſign to make; he fell dead on the Place, and I ſaw him in the ſame Inſtant, wherein he was living, and healthful, to expire. Were I of the <hi>Sect</hi> of our Philoſopher <hi>Muſlaadin Saadi,</hi> I would tell thee, It matters not, whether one dies ſuddenly, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a long Time; whether a Man dies in his Bed, or at the Gallows. But, I being none of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and knowing no <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> or Philoſopher, amongſt ſo many <hi>Sects</hi> than were in <hi>Greece, who</hi> diſputed, Whether Life or Death was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: So, expect not from me any Arguings on the <hi>Morals</hi> of thoſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor yet of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:46436:72"/>But, if Death be ſuch a terrible Thing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live in ſuch a Manner, that it may never affright thee, when it ſhall approach thee, or when thou ſhalt ſee it invade others; expecting it at all times, and in all places. Doſt thou know by what Herb, or by what ſecret Magick Charm I do not fear it? 'Tis by the leading of an Innocent Life. Here is publiſhed, and that with great Reaſon, the laſt Words of a Man of great Birth; who died when he was very Old, by a Wound he receeived. He had ſerved divers Kings in Places of the higheſt Truſt; and being mortally wounded in a Battel, mark what he ſaid to thoſe, that exhorted him to die like a good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and with the ſame Courage he had ſhewed in Life: His Reply was, <hi>That a Man who had lived well Fourſcore Years, cannot be to ſeek how to die well for a Quarter of an Hour.</hi> This great Man, who was a famous Soldier, was alſo a true <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> and I might ſay, he was a <hi>Saint,</hi> had he been of <hi>our Religion.</hi> I believe, he was a moſt edifying Spectacle, and the more conſiderable, in as much as the Example he gave of dying well, is more valuable, than that which he gave in ſo many Battels of courageous Fighting. He was called <hi>Anne de Montmorancy, Conſtable of France;</hi> whoſe Life I had the Curioſity of reading; being to be found in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But, before I end this Letter, let me denote to thee, the Difference there is between the Effects of Grief and Joy. The Meſſenger, from <hi>England,</hi> of whom I already ſpake, finding at his Return, the Old Man, whom he had left dying, ſtill alive; he gave him ſuch a ſtrange Stroke, by telling to him the Death of his Son, that Grief having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Aſſaults of Death, reſtored to this unhappy Old Man, that Strength he had loſt in his Health; ſo that coming himſelf, ſome Days
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46436:73"/>after, to <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſaw him bewail the Loſs of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son.</p>
                  <p>He that ſaid heretofore, <hi>A man ſhould learn all his Life to die well,</hi> uttered no ſtrange Doctrine. Our days will laſt long enough, if we be ready to ſay, at all times, <hi>We have lived enough,</hi> And, if we love, as we ought, our great Emperor, who is Invincible, Holy, and the moſt Juſt amongſt Men: And, if we obſerve what a <hi>French</hi> Peaſant ſaid to all thoſe that paſſed before his Door; <hi>Never deny your Aſſiſtance, and never do any Body any Hurt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let thou and, I number our Days, (as was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heretofore in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to the <hi>white Eunuchs,</hi> by the <hi>Perſian,</hi> whoſe Eyes were put out becauſe he ſaw too clearly.) He always inſiſted on the <hi>Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neertainty,</hi> and <hi>Vanity of Humane Life.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Twas ſhort, conſidering what he had to do in it; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as to what we ſhall do in it; and always mix'd with what we have done, and what remains for us to do.</hi> Teach not thy Son <hi>Mehemet</hi> yet, for whom thou haſt ſo much Affection, theſe Precepts. Children have not that Ripeneſs of Judgment, as is neceſſary, to hear Diſcourſes of Death: They are too hard Bits for their Stomachs, and which, indeed, Old Men can hardly digeſt; and which they ſwallow not without feeling all the Bitterneſs of them.</p>
                  <p>I pray <hi>God</hi> keep the <hi>Imperial</hi> City; with thoſe that dwell in it, and ſhelter it from the Storms which fall on infamous Cities; and, I beſeech him, thou mayſt live without Offence, that thou mayſt never fear Death.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHEN I parted from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I gave thee a Stone of excellent Virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gravel, and thou preſented'ſt me with a Paper, which was to ſecure me againſt all bodily Evils. Time only can decide which of us two made the beſt Preſent to his Friend. Thou haſt pretended to learn me in few Words, how to live amongſt the <hi>Infidels;</hi> and I thought in giving thee a Stone, to give thee a Remedy againſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper thou art troubled with. I never turn my ſelf towards the Place where <hi>Mecha</hi> lies, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member where thy Amity began, and how far ſince it has been extended towards me. Abſence has not leſſened thy Kindneſs, nor hindred thee from ſending me thy grave Counſels; but I am as yet too young, to ſet about the preparing my ſelf for the <hi>other World;</hi> and too vigorous and healthful, to hearken to thy ſerious and melancholy Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh thou wert but at <hi>Paris,</hi> where thou wouldeſt ſee a great Number of People, who ſell a moſt precious Thing, to purchaſe a vain and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Title: How many with great Earneſtneſs ſue for <hi>Placeat</hi>'s from the King, that they may ſeek their Deaths? Perhaps thou never thoughteſt there were any ſuch kind of People. What doſt thou think then of the Souldiery in General; are they any others than Martyrs of Ambition, to whom one would think Life is a Burthen? 'Tis a ſad Spectacle, to ſee how many Dead lie in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46436:74"/>Streets; or carried on the Shoulders of their Friends or Kinſmen to their Graves: Yet this is ſo common a thing in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the People make no Wonder of it.</p>
                  <p>This way of Living, obliges me to do as the reſt. I begin to conſider, That what happens to another, may happen to me; there's no avoiding ones <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> This Preface is only to bring in a Story of this King's Goodneſs, which ought to be an Example to all Princes. The <hi>French</hi> have need of freſh Souldiers to fill up ſo many Troops as they continually entertain: Not long ſince then, there came a Man, full of Years, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Deſpair, who deſired to be Liſted in this Princes Service. To obtain what he deſired, he told the King, <hi>That he was the Father of Twelve Children, Seven of which were Daughters, who were Marriagable; that he could no longer live, being not able to maintain ſuch a great Family; and, that being ignorant, as yet how to die, he would learn it in the King's Service.</hi> The Prince having appointed him to wait upon him one Day pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in his Cloſet, thus ſpake to him: <hi>Thy Deſpair makes thee deſirous to be liſted amongſt my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and Charity obliges me to retain thee amongſt the Citizens. Thoſe that are Fools when they enter into Troops, commonly come out wiſer; becauſe they learn ſeveral things of which they were before ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: but as to thy part, what Time haſt thou to learn, who art ready to fall dead at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou entereſt into the School? Yet I receive thee; take this Sword; go and combat thy Folly; and take this Purſe to ſuccour thy Family, and be cured; but if thou art wiſe, ſay not from whom thou haſt received thy Cure.</hi> I know not what Sum was in the Purſe, no more than I do of what Mettle the Sword was. But I have this Story from an Officer of the King's Cloſet; with whom I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46436:74"/>have that ſtrict Converſe, that he told me this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as ſoon as ever it happened.</p>
                  <p>I'll tell thee if thou wilt, ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Paſſages of my Life; for I conceal nothing from the Miniſters, and the moſt venerable <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> who knows all that I do: I adore the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Maſter of the Univerſe; and have a great Veneration for his <hi>holy Prophet:</hi> I never defiled my Hands in Blood, neither have I ever violated any Mans Bed: I eaſily forgive my Enemies, and hate above all things the Crime of Slandering. If this be not ſufficient to merit Salvation, I do not know what is. Theſe are all my Virtues; as to other Qualifications, I have none. I have no Knack at Thieving; my Talents lie not that way; were I qualified, I might, as moſt do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe means to put my Art in Practice. But living according to theſe afore-mentioned Maxims, I doubt not but I ſhall find Entrance into that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, where faithful Souls will enjoy a perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and ſet their Feet on the Necks of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Holy <hi>Law;</hi> where, they ſhall ſuffer neither Hunger, Thirſt, or Nakedneſs; free from the parching Heats of the Sun, and the pinching Sharpneſs of the Colds, cauſed by the Moon; where, under the agreeable Shade of Trees, they ſhall gather the preciouſeſt Fruit, ſtanding, ſitting, or lying; and drink in Cups of Gold or Emerald, the moſt delicious Liquors, which ſpring from a clear Fountain; and be ſerved with inconceivable Magnificence. In this divine Place, they ſhall be more beautiful and ſhining than the Stars in the Firmament, whoſe brightneſs enlightens the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Night; their Robes ſhall be of fineſt Silk, of a Colour more green and pleaſing to the Eye, than the Herbs which ſpring up in <hi>May;</hi> and ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive from the Hands of God, a Potion, more ſweet and delicious, than can be imagined,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46436:75"/>as a Recompence for the Good they have done, during their Abode amongſt Men. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, 'tis impoſſible for me to go on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> ſeeing I am obliged to abide at <hi>Paris.</hi> Thou knoweſt alſo, I cannot give my ſelf to Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being forced to lead an active Life; for I muſt not remain among the <hi>Derviſes,</hi> who paſs their Days in Solitude; ſerving in <hi>France,</hi> as I muſt do, our Puiſſant and Invincible Emperor. Thou ſeeſt here what my Condition will bear; accuſe me not therefore for neglecting the pious Advices thou giveſt me. I forget not ſo much Death, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that I muſt die.</p>
                  <p>Be informed of this from me, There's not a Town in the World, where People do learn better to live ill, than at <hi>Paris;</hi> neither is there any Place, where they are better taught to die. I need not tell thee, here are publick <hi>Academies</hi> (as were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore amongſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) wherein dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies lie expoſed to publick View, to make Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the indiſpenſable Neceſſity of dying. But I may tell thee, there's no Day, wherein in this great Town, a great quantity of Fools do not teach wiſer than themſelves, things they have been ever igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; for the Gibbets and Scaffolds, ſet up for the Puniſhment of the Guilty, hinder the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a great many People, whoſe Innocency is preſerved by theſe kind of Spectacles. Here the Poor who had heretofore plentiful Subſiſtences, teach good Husbandry; the Proud, Humility; the debauched with Women, Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>I believe, there is no Part of the World, where there are more Thieves and Pick-pockets, and who do their Work with greater Art and Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they exerciſe their Craft in all Places, in the Churches, as well as the Streets, Markets, and Bridges; ſo that our People of the <hi>Morea,</hi> who are thought by us to be ſuch great Maſters in

                     <hi>To</hi> Cara Hali, <hi>the Phyſician.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Know not whether what I thought I ſaw laſt Night in my Bed, be the effect of a Dream, or of a real Viſion. I was awakned by a great Earth-quake, and which made me riſe afrighted out of my Bed. But informing my ſelf by ſome People, I found 'twas but a Dream.</p>
                  <p>My Adventure, has renewed the Remembrance of one, which proved of ſad Conſequence to one Part of <hi>Italy.</hi> Phyſicians are at a loſs to find out the Cauſes of theſe horrible Fires, which are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited up at certain times by Mount <hi>Gibel, Strom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli,</hi> and <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> Mountains in <hi>Sicily,</hi> not far from <hi>Naples,</hi> whoſe Roots ſeem to ſpring from Hell; whence ariſe often filthy Exhalations, Smoaks and Sulphur, with Flames which caſt up Stones and Aſhes to the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>'Tis known, I believe, at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> That towards the Beginning of the Moon of <hi>February,</hi> there was loſt near <hi>Naples</hi> a little Iſland, that had Four Miles in Compaſs. It's related as a Thing certain, That after this Iſle was ſuddenly ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down into the Sea, the Fire which it included not finding its uſual Vent, there was opened ſome Days after, a new Way along the Coaſts of <hi>Calabria,</hi> near <hi>Meſſina.</hi> There did it appear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt cauſed an horrible Earth-quake, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46436:76"/>overthrew a great Pile of Building, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call a <hi>Steeple,</hi> that belonged to a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church; which buried under its Ruins a vaſt Number of People, whoſe Devotion had at that Time brought hither. Some Towns of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> ſuffered by this Earthquake, with great Multitudes of People, and Herds of Cattle, which were miſerably loſt in the Fire, by the Smoak and heaps of Aſhes. And amongſt thoſe that have been ſmothered to death, are reckoned ſeveral Lords of thoſe Countries, who are Maſters but of few Subjects, and yet bear the Title of Princes.</p>
                  <p>My dear Friend, <hi>Cara Hali,</hi> Theſe are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of Nature, whoſe Cauſes will not be ſound out by us. Certainly, theſe Countries of <hi>Italy,</hi> muſt be far from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſeeing theſe Mouths of <hi>Hell</hi> (if it he true, as many People ſay, they are in theſe Mountains) do frequently ruin by theſe Irruptions <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Sicily. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts</hi> affirm, That theſe Mountains nouriſh Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Matter in their Bowels, which is eaſily inflamed, and iſſues out with more or leſs Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and more or leſs Frequency, according as the Matter is more or leſs diſpoſed; and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Winds kindle and eject theſe Fires, and open the Maſs of Earth under which they are ſhut up. But the Opinion of certain <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who maintain, That meer Chance produces theſe extraordinary Events, appears to me very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; affirming, that one Stone ſtriking another, produces a Spark, whence happen theſe great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations: Nay, they proceed farther, and would perſwade us, That a lighted Lamp, left by Chance, by thoſe who ſearched into the Bowels of theſe Mountains, to diſcover the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, might make theſe Flames; which lighting on a combuſtible Matter, and meeting with no hing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46436:76"/>that is contrary to 'em to extinguiſh them, do cauſe theſe ſurpriſing Effects. They alſo ſay, That Lightning ſtriking fiercely on ſome one of the Coaſts of theſe Mountains, may do the ſame thing; as the Stones ſtriking one againſt another, or the Lamp left lighted.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Opinions would not appear ſo ridiculous, were it poſſible to make any Demonſtration of 'em: But theſe Events being all extraordinary, and in a manner prodigious, I ſhall willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee to believe, that 'tis a Work of Nature, or Hell, or Chance alone, which cauſes the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Motions of theſe Fires; which are ſo terrible, and ſo greatly damnify one of the fineſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in the World, as <hi>Greece</hi> is, and this Iſland which is the Delight and Nurſe of almoſt all the Provinces ſituated on the Banks of the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean-Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find alſo in <hi>Ireland</hi> theſe Mountains of Fire, yet with this Difference, that their Flames do no Hurt, which make 'em no ways dreadful to the Inhabitants. I think too I have heard my Father ſay, That being in Company with certain <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> in our <hi>Lycia,</hi> he ſaw theſe kind of Fires come out of the Earth, but they broke out gently and cauſed no Damage.</p>
                  <p>I am now perſwaded of one Thing, which I would never believe before; which is, That Old <hi>Pliny,</hi> intending to relate to the Emperor <hi>Titus,</hi> and leave to Poſterity a Relation of the Effects of <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> and a perfect Diſcovery of the Cauſes of ſo many prodigious Effects, he therefore went himſelf on the Place; becauſe that in his Time, this famous Mountain had caſt out an horrible Quantity of Fire, Stones, and Aſhes, with ſo great Violence, and ſuch terrible Noiſe, that the Effects of it were ſelt in <hi>Syria, Africk,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Egypt.</hi> But the Curioſity of this wretched Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46436:77"/>having coſt him his Life, the <hi>Romans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſtill with his Return, the Diſcovery of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Cauſes of ſo many prodigious Effects. Take care of thine own Health, and let not any of thy Patients miſcarry through thy Neglect, or Raſhneſs. Continue to love me, though I am at a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thee: Write to me ſometimes; and believe, that I am not able to conform my ſelf to the way of Living of Strangers amongſt whom I reſide. I ſhall be always a good <hi>Muſſul man,</hi> and a Faithful Friend.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THY Decree is very cruel, to ſeparate me, without having committed any Crime, from the Communion of the <hi>Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have read the Holy Anſwer thou haſt made me, with great Veneration; but this has not been without many Tears. Thou haſt not untyed the Knot of the Difficulties which perplex me, but made it indiſſoluble. So that I only live in the Certainty of having no Certitude, and my Soul, which is encompaſſed with Fear, will be in Dread till Death.</p>
                  <p>If I do what thou propoſeſt, how ſhall I be ſure of not failing, ſeeing I do not underſtand what I ought to do? I am ſo dull, that I cannot diſtinguiſh, Whether thou exhorteſt me to do
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46436:77"/>what I have ever done, or whether thou forbiddeſt me what I asked of thee.</p>
                  <p>I intreated thee to let me know, Whether I might live amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and do in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, what they do effectually in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Ceremonies of their Religion: And thou anſwereſt me, That the <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> or <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> ſhould have no Doubt in his Law, and needs no other Precepts to obſerve it, than the Law it ſelf: Moreover, That the true <hi>Muſſulman</hi> muſt be willing to loſe his Eſtate, his Life, and Honour in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Service; That the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the True God, the Emperor, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and, that, in fine, one ought to ſacrifice all Things not to betray this God, who is our chief Maſter. Tell me, I intreat thee on my bended Knees, Cannot a Man be a True <hi>Mahometan,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hating eternally the Followers of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> And in living amongſt them ſecretly a true <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> muſt one ſhew ones ſelf to be of another Religion, or pretend to be of theirs? Thou wilt tell me, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſpeaks with great Clearneſs, yet how many obſcure Paſſages do we find in the Words of our <hi>holy Prophet,</hi> wherein we need thy Expoſitions?</p>
                  <p>I have no Belief for <hi>Tagot,</hi> neither will I give Credit to the <hi>Devil;</hi> my Law expreſly forbids it, for I believe in one only True God, who knew the Intention of our <hi>holy Lawgiver,</hi> and ſees what we cannot diſcover. And the <hi>Prophet</hi> cries out, That he that has ſuch Principles, leans on the ſtrongeſt Prop he can ever meet with; there being nothing which is able to overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>Diſperſe, Reverend Sir, as much as thou canſt, the Darkneſs of my Spirit. I conjure thee by the Almighty Father, who can make live Fleſh come on the dry Bones of the Aſs, which dyed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years paſt.</p>

                  <p>I do not diſcontinue here my uſual Prayers, which I make in the Manner they are preſcribed me by the Law, with my Face always turn'd to the Side of <hi>Mecha.</hi> When I faſt, I eat only at Night, and I continue my Repaſt till <hi>Aurora</hi> advancing the Day, gives me Light enough to diſtinguiſh black Thread from white. And I paſs over the Day without taking any Nouriſhment, till the Darkneſs be ſo great, that I cannot ſee the Eye of a Needle. 'Tis true, I give no Alms to the Poor, becauſe I doubt, Whether it be lawful to do good to thoſe who continually move Heaven againſt us.</p>

They live, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, good Lives; are obliged to know all the Points of their Law, they muſt be Doctors, are obliged to Gelibacy, to be Sober, Hoſpitable, Prudent, Irreprehenſible, without coveting others Goods; they muſt never be drunk, or ſhed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Blood.

                  <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Armies are at preſent in <hi>Winter</hi>-Quarters, and the <hi>Court</hi> is buſied in contriving what they ſhall do in the <hi>Spring.</hi> I do not believe I writ thee any falſe News; for it is to be believed that the Sharpneſs of the Winter will hinder any Thing from being undertaken before that time.</p>
                  <p>The Eyes of all the <hi>Court</hi> are fixed on Three Objects, the King, the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his Son, and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu;</hi> but they more carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the latter, than the former. This Man has made himſelf Creatures by his Benefits; the Thankfulneſs for which, and the Hopes of new ones, has bound them to his Intereſts. Yet 'tis to be believed, he has more Enemies by means of the great Credit he is in with his Prince, and the Occaſions he finds to increaſe it. His Anti-chamber is always full of Attendants, who aſpire to Employs, of ſuch as are in Offices, and ſeveral other Perſons who are deſirous to be Witneſſes of his Actions. Thoſe who threaten him in ſecret, do but increaſe his Courage, and make him more carefully ſtand on his Guard; and thoſe who have moſt Experience of the World, affirm, this <hi>Cardinal</hi> knows too much to be ſurpriſed.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46436:79"/>Hear the Recital of one of the leaſt of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby thou maiſt figure the greateſt, and give them the due Price they deſerve. For Three Years together was obſerved in this <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Anti-chamber, a Man who was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ot far advanced in Years, and as aſſiduous to make his Court, as he was modeſt in his Diſcourſe; very reſerved and patient; and, which is very rare at Court, was never heard to complain. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to read the Souls of Men, and who is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none perhaps in this Art, cauſed this Perſon who had ſo long attended, to be called to him, and thus ſpake to him: <hi>I know who thou art, and how long time thou haſt ſpent in obſerving me; although thou outwardly appeareſt a</hi> French-man, <hi>thy great Patience aſſures me thou art of another Climate; get thee to</hi> Rome, <hi>and wait but half the time in the</hi> Pope<hi>'s Anti-chamber as thou haſt done in mine, and I doubt not but thou wilt penetrate into the moſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Secrets. Part then immediately for</hi> Italy, <hi>and obſerve the Actions and Motions of the Wiſeſt and moſt Diſſimulative Court in the Univerſe; diſcover not thy ſelf to any body; ſend me an Account every Week what thou canſt diſcover; and in this manner thou wilt be uſeful to me, and avoid Idleneſs. My</hi> Secretary <hi>will give thee a Cypher, and my</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer <hi>has order to give thee what's neceſſary for thy Voyage, as well as to keep thee when thou art at</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſtudies to extend the Bounds of the Kingdom, and for that purpoſe conſults thoſe who can any ways advance his Projects; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the King being now certain of a Succeſſor, by the Birth of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who ſeems very likely to live long. All Hands are employed at <hi>Toulon</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles</hi> for the fitting out of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and other Veſſels; and 'tis thought the chief Deſigns of this Miniſter, are on the Coaſts of

                     <hi>Italy.</hi> I am told, he was heard to ſay, That the <hi>Romans</hi> could never have conquered all the World, as they did, had they not before been Maſters of <hi>Italy;</hi> That <hi>Hannibal</hi> had the ſame Deſign, and after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. intended to ſee whether ſuch a Deſign would take Effect; but his Pride and Cruelty made all his Projects prove abortive, and that he could meet with greater Succeſs than <hi>Hannibal,</hi> could he be ſo happy as to obtain one Thing. And here he ended his Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſo greatly minds whatever paſſes in the <hi>Royal</hi> Family and Kingdom, that he can diſcover, as he pretends, all the Thoughts, yea and the very Dreams of the Grandees, Governors of Provinces, and thoſe that command in Places.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, he has learnt ſeveral uſeful Things in the Relation given us of the Government of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> having from them the Way of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the moſt difficult Matters, without its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing he does any Thing for this Purpoſe. And this is the Method of governing he obſerves in this Kingdom, wherein are ſo many reſtleſs Spirits.</p>
                  <p>He maintains, near all People who are in any conſiderable Offices, Perſons that depend only on him, and who are known to no body elſe; who in all Places wear mean Cloaths, and inceſſantly watch over the Actions of the Officers, and give him notice of whatever paſſes. He makes uſe of theſe kind of People about his Maſter's Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in foreign <hi>Courts.</hi> He always carries a Book about with him, which he calls <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Soul; which Book contains the Deſigns, the Intereſts, the ſecret Practices, and Inclinations of all the Princes, who hold a Correſpondence, and have any Tyes with <hi>France,</hi> and on whom <hi>France</hi> has any Pretenſions. The moſt skilful <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:46436:80"/>have alſo ſent him the Horoſcopes of all the Kings, and great Men, with their Judgments touching the Term of their Lives, and what they may probably undertake in all Times. This <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> ſaid on another Time, That he kept a great many Couriers, yet he could well enough ſpare them; That he knew what paſſed in remote Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſoon as what was done near him: He once affirmed, he knew in leſs than Two Hours, That the King of <hi>England</hi> had ſigned the Warrant for the Execution of ...... If this Particular be true, this Miniſter muſt be more than a Man. Thoſe who are his moſt devoted Creatures, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm he has in a private place in his Cloſet, a certain Mathematical Figure, in the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of which, are written all the Letters of the Alphabet, armed with a Dart, which marks the Letters, which are alſo marked by their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents: And it appears, that this Dart ripens by the Sympathy of a Stone, which thoſe who give and receive his Advices, keep always at hand, which hath been ſeparated from another, which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> has always by him; and 'tis affirm'd, that with ſuch an Inſtrument, he gives and receives immediately Advices. This great Man, who knows all theſe reports, only laughs at them; yet he ſays with a ſerious Air, That God has given him Two Angels, one White and another Black, to inform him of both good and bad Matters, and that with their Aſſiſtance he ſhall overthrow the Cabals of his Enemies. He ſent ſome Days paſt a Man to the Gallies, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for cutting in pieces the King's Picture; but having been better inform'd, and knowing twas his, he told thoſe about him, That this Man ſhould be pardoned, becauſe he had done no Hurt to the Original. Here are Theaters and Feaſts preparing to entertain the People, in Honour of the King
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46436:80"/>and <hi>Cardinal;</hi> and 'tis whiſpered, that the Queen is again with Child.</p>

                  <p>IF thou goeſt into <hi>Pruſſia</hi> in <hi>Bithynin,</hi> as thou writeſt, above all Things remember to prepare thy ſelf not to live long, and never to inform the young <hi>Sultan Muſtapha</hi> of the Misfortune of the Grandſon to <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and Son to poor <hi>Bajazet,</hi> whom his Grandfather cauſed to be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his Infancy. This unhappy place makes me fearful of thy Life, as well as that of the Prince's, the Care of whoſe Education is committed to thee. I cannot forbear weeping, every time I call to mind what paſſed between the Victim and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. Thou thy ſelf toldeſt me, That this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Child embraced and kiſſed ſeveral times him that was to give the Fatal Stroke, even in the Moment when he was putting about his Neck the Silken String which was to ſtrangle him. All <hi>Aſia</hi> is informed of the reſt of the Hiſtory; and 'tis known, That this Child altho ſtrang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed, yet triumphed at his Death over his Murtherer: For being ſoftned by the Careſſes of this Infant, whom he was about deſtroying, he dropt down in a Swoon; and <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Son had by this Occaſion eſcaped
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46436:81"/>Death, had not the other Executioner, more cruel than the former, done the Work.</p>
                  <p>Altho thou doſt not, certainly know, who is <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Father; yet thou maiſt well preſume he is the Emperor's Son. Thy Age and Prudence ſo long experienced, and the-Office of <hi>Chief</hi> of all the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> which thou haſt ſo long enjoyed, leaves no place of doubting, but that thy Pupil is of <hi>Royal</hi> Blood. Arm thy ſelf then with Courage and ſtudy to perform well thy Duty in this ſolitary Place: Nothing is ſo troubleſom as the inſtructing of Children, when they will be taught as Maſters by their Slaves, and will not ſubmit to Rules, like private Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Thou maiſt be ſure, I ſhall render thee all the Service I am able, ſeeing I conſider thee as a Friend that is extream dear to me: But why doſt thou ſeek amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> an illuſtrious Subject, which may ſerve for a Model to form a Child born in the Religion of the <hi>Muſſulmen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did I not know thy Wiſdom, I ſhould think thou art very ſimple, in ſearching after Examples amongſt the Enemies of our <hi>holy Law,</hi> to propoſe them to be followed by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Children. Thou haſt choſen for this Purpoſe <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> termed <hi>the Great;</hi> and art thou ignorant, that this ſo famous a King was the moſt implacable Enemy of the <hi>Empire?</hi> Be it known to thee, That this Prince undertook the boldeſt and dangerouſeſt Deſign as was ever imagined, to deſtroy the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmen;</hi> and might probably have ſucceeded, had not Heaven, by an unforeſeen Stroke, ſnatched him from the Earth, to appear before the Tribunal of the True God, who judges Kings as well as other Men. But leſt thou ſhould'ſt imgin, I make this a Pretence to excuſe my ſelf from ſatisfying thee in what thou deſireſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at leaſt one Part of what thou expecteſt:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46436:81"/>Thou wouldſt have me ſend thee the Hiſtory of this Prince; content thy ſelf with a ſhort Extract of it, otherwiſe I muſt be forced to ſend thee a large Volume. However, make not uſe of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in all Things; the Way of Living, the Laws and Cuſtoms of the <hi>French,</hi> do not ſuit with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Way of Regiment. If thou wilt make thy Pupil accompliſhed, form him on the Model of ſome one of thoſe <hi>Hero's</hi> which the <hi>Eaſt</hi> has given us. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> will read with greater Profit, the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> than that of <hi>Charlemain</hi> and <hi>Henry;</hi> and ſhould one wonder at the Defaults of the King of <hi>Macedonia</hi>'s Son, and at the ſmall Fortune of the other? Pray ſhew me what Men there ever were, who had at the ſame time the Frailties of human Nature, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divinity.</p>
                  <p>And if thou wilt ſearch into <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> thou wilt find a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and an <hi>Artaxerxes, Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Pſammeticus, Campſon,</hi> and <hi>Tomombeis,</hi> all great Princes, whoſe Actions honour Antiquity. And how many <hi>Heroes</hi> wilt thou find in our <hi>Greece,</hi> if thou wilt take no Notice of thoſe whom <hi>Rome</hi> has ſent into the World? But not to go out of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Family, thou knoweſt very well, that we <hi>Turks,</hi> have for Proverbial Speeches, <hi>The Modeſty of</hi> Solyman; <hi>The good Mien of</hi> Alis; <hi>The Juſtice of</hi> Nonquirevan; <hi>The Majeſty of</hi> Oſman; <hi>The Gravity of</hi> Humer; and <hi>the Juſtice of</hi> Abubekir; not to mention the Courage and Magnanimity of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> who is, at this Day, more valorous than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his common Soldiers; whether he be in his <hi>Seraglio</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or in his Tents before <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ten Days ago I received thy Letter, and I have employed a great deal of that Time, in collecting what thou haſt deſired of me; and to ſpeak truly, thy Commands have ſuppli'd me with matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46436:82"/>to divert me. Thou wilt be without doubt ſurprized, that Two Men who long ſerved this King in mean Employs, have diſcovered ſeveral Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his Life, with which the <hi>French</hi> themſelves, perhaps, are not acquainted. My Sentiment has ever been, That 'tis more neceſſary to know the Manners and Cuſtoms of Men, than to know the Number of Places they have beſieged or taken; and to be informed of their good Qualities and bad ones, than to learn the Manner of their Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Number of the Battles which they have won or loſt. All Hiſtories contain the Actions of Men, and the Principal is, to know theſe Men, to inſtruct others; for Hiſtories do generally rather divert, than inſtruct Men. Theſe will teach thee better what thou art to learn, than the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> themſelves. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors are, at preſent, like the Elements; always in War, and ever contrary to one another, and never agreeing.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Two above-mentioned Friends, who are now very old Men, have ſerved King <hi>Henry</hi> above Thirty Years, and ever held a ſtrict Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with one another. One was his Barber; and the other's Buſineſs was to divert him with reading to him, when he was going to Reſt.</p>
                  <p>That which is related of <hi>Henry</hi>'s coming into the World without weeping, is certainly a Fable; but it is certain, the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſung a <hi>French</hi> Song, in the Time of his Birth; whereby this Princeſs ſeemed to ſhew other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that 'tis poſſible to be brought to Bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Crying out. The firſt Milk which this Royal Babe drank, was an <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> which the Gods of our Friend, the Poet <hi>Oglou,</hi> never taſted. His Father made him drink in a Golden Cup, of the ſtrongeſt Wine that could be gotten; wherein he put and ſqueezed a Clove of Garlick, which he thought proper to ſtrengthen his Temperament,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46436:82"/>and render him more vigorous. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bred up like <hi>Cyrus;</hi> ſpending his firſt Days in Woods, and oftentimes in the Company of Sheepherds. He went always with his Head bare, whether expoſed to the ſcorching Heats of the Summers Sun; or during Winter, to the Rain, and moſt rigorous Froſts, Snow and Hail. It ſeems as if he had began his Life in Priſon; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Fields, diſtant from all Converſe, clad in coarſe Hair-cloth, to accuſtom his Body to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, and ſouple his Spirit to the Accidents of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>He was but Nine Years old, when he loſt his Father <hi>Anthony,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> The Death of this Prince may ſerve for a Leſſon to <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> for, having received his Death's Wound, at the Siege of a conſiderable Place, he made the Wall of the Chamber, where he lay, to be broken down, that he might be carried into his own Bed, dying as it were in Triumph, into the Town: miſerable Ambition of Great Men, who ſtrip not themſelves of it, till Death ſtrips them of their Lives. Seven Years after the Death of <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Young <hi>Henry</hi> was declared Head, and Defender of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; and when Eighteen Years old, he was in a conſiderable Fight; but 'tis not well known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himſelf was engaged. Fortune was ſo contrary to him in the Beginning, that having loſt a Battle, he was obliged to fly for Six Months, together with the reſt of his Army; and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe almoſt throughout all the Provinces of the Kingdom, without taking any Reſt, for Fear of being ſurprized. Thou haſt never read, I believe, of any Captain, that made a Flight of that durance, before him. The Queen his Mother, being a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a maſculine Courage, and Firmneſs of Mind, dyed poyſoned by a pair of Gloves. At Nineteen Years of Age, he married the King's Siſter, who
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46436:83"/>then Reigned, named <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and never any Wedding was ſolemnized with ſuch bloody Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 'Tis hard to believe what an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Hugonots</hi> was then maſſacred; the Deſign was ſecretly laid, during the Celebration of the Wedding, and executed Six Days after, at full Noon. 'Tis ſaid, that in one Day, all <hi>France</hi> was died with the Blood of theſe poor People; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leaſt an Hundred thouſand of them ſlain; amongſt which were Twenty <hi>Lords</hi> of great Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, with the Great <hi>Admiral</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and at the feweſt Four thouſand Soldiers maſſacred in <hi>Paris. Henry</hi> did not periſh on that unhappy Day, but he was very near Death; and the King having called him, thus ſpake to him, with an angry Tone, and fierce Countenance: Henry, <hi>thou art alive, becauſe I would ſpare thee; but I will not ſpare thee, if thou perſiſteſt in thy</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: <hi>Chooſe one of theſe two things; either the</hi> Maſs, <hi>or</hi> Death. If thou knoweſt not what the <hi>Maſs</hi> is, I will ſhew thee in another Letter. This Prince choſe to go to <hi>Maſs,</hi> rather than to loſe his Life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publickly abjured the Religion he profeſſed. Theſe two old Men affirm, That <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>'s Court, were never corrupted as that of <hi>France</hi> was then. No People were more in Faſhion, than Buffoons, and never did the worſt ſort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries ſo abound; Sorceries, Empoyſonings, Aſſaſſinations, and all other Sorts of Crimes, were permitted in ſuch a Manner, that all the Laws and good Order ſeem'd to be overthrown. 'Tis not known, whether the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> took up his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Religion through Policy, or ſome Corruption he ſaw amongſt the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> however, he return'd ſome Time after to <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> whereunto he was ſo obſtinately addicted, that having lived ſeveral Years in this <hi>Sect,</hi> he was forced to offer great Violence to himſelf, to enjoy peaceably the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46436:83"/>of <hi>France,</hi> and accommodate himſelf with the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make again publick Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Never any Prince more loved Women than he did. This Paſſion prevailed over him all the Days of his Life, and there were Two different Natures obſervable in his Perſon; <hi>An Invincible Courage in the Field; and ſuch a Paſſion for Women, as made him be often ſeen to Weep amongſt them.</hi> He has had greater Weakneſſes than <hi>Hercules,</hi> and he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in them. He challenged the braveſt Man in all <hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to a ſingle Fight; but the King interpoſed his Authority to hinder the Combat.</p>
                  <p>This King performed an Action during his Youth, which our <hi>Derviſes</hi> would have certainly ſet down in their Regiſters as greatly remarkable. On a certain Day wherein he was to fight a pitched Battle, being on Horſeback in the midſt of his Army, he made publick Reparation to a young Woman whom he had deflowred, and ſpake in theſe Terms: <hi>I have forced this Woman you ſee here; and uſed Threats, when Entreaties would not bring her to my Luſt. Let all that hear me, deteſt the bad Example I have given. And as for your part whom I have thus wronged, chooſe an Husband, and receive from me ſuch a Portion, as may ſeem in ſome ſort, an Amends for the Injury I have done you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems as if this ſo laudable an Action was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by Heaven; for having immediately hereupon given Battle, he overthrew a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with a few Troops.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies who bore <hi>Henry</hi> no Ill-will, for his Tenderneſs to their Sex, greatly intereſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Affairs of War, wherein this Prince was always Head of the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party; and they gave Occaſion to a Proverb which laſted a great
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:46436:84"/>while. There being ſome, who were for making a Peace, and others for War; This War was called <hi>The Ladies War.</hi> This Prince had been in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fights, that I believe one may truly ſay in this particular, never any Prince came near him: For, who ever in one Day was in two Battles, and came off victorious?</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. dying during this Time, the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> ſent for her other Son in great Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, who had been elected ſome Months before King of <hi>Poland,</hi> by the Death of <hi>Sigiſmond Auguſtus.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Charles</hi>'s Succeſſor having been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of the Death of the King his Brother, fled in the Night from <hi>Cracovia,</hi> only with Two Perſons who were his Confidents, and retired to <hi>Venice;</hi> and 'tis ſaid, That the <hi>Courtiſans</hi> of this famous City, having aſſured the Crown to our <hi>Henry,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been infected with this Diſtemper, which the <hi>French</hi> call the <hi>Neapolitan Diſeaſe,</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>French-Pox;</hi> he became incapable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children, to perpetuate the Crown in the Branch of <hi>Valois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his Death, which was violent, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by a <hi>Chriſtian Derviſe, Henry</hi> III. dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Heir, and his Throne being ſought by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Pretenders; <hi>Henry,</hi> to whom alone his Birth had given Right, became Maſter of it by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; his Fatigues in War, and his Courage made him vanquiſh all Obſtacles. He maintained his Right with an unparallel'd Valour, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf with the greateſt Prudence; yet his greateſt Succeſſes, are owing to the Greatneſs of his Heart. He met ſometimes with Diſadvantage, but oftner came out Conqueror from all Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and 'tis obſervable, he was the prouder after the Battles won, becauſe he had before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared extraordinary familiar with the Souldiers who had helped him to win them. He was wont
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46436:84"/>to be often in his Stables to ſee his Horſes, and often ſlept amongſt theſe Creatures, whom he termed his moſt faithful Courtiers. How difficult ſoever the way was which was to lead him to the Throne, he would not be diſheartned; theſe Difficulties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only to increaſe his Courage. He ſaw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> confederated with his Enemies; yet he alone, without any other Aſſiſtance, but of ſome few faithful Troops, ſate down before <hi>Paris,</hi> which was the moſt famous Siege ſince that of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus.</hi> He reduced the Inhabitants of this Capital of the Kingdom, to live on the moſt abject Meats one can imagin, after they had conſumed the Rats, Mice, Dogs, and Cats, which were for ſome time the richeſt Delicacies the beſt People of the Town could meet with. But he was for all this (after he had given ſeveral Aſſaults) forced to raiſe the Siege, and accommodate himſelf with the <hi>Prince</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all the Prieſts amongſt the <hi>Catholicks;</hi> and he again renounced <hi>Calviniſm</hi> wherewith he was infected, and which ſerved as a Pretence to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He was crown'd in the ſame manner his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Predeceſſors had been before him. He began to govern his Kingdom, ruined by ſo many Wars, Pillages and Concuſſions made by all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo repaired it by his good Government, that he was ſoon in a Condition to embelliſh it. He built ſeveral magniſicent Bridges, raiſed ſtately Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and forgot nothing which might re-eſtabliſh thoſe good Orders which the Licentiouſneſs of the Times had overthrown.</p>
                  <p>But what this King deſigned againſt us, as ſoon as he was ſetled on the Throne, will appear at the ſame time to thee both dreadful and admirable. As ſoon as ever he had made a general Peace with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he laid the Foundations of the moſt Heroick Deſign that ever Man invented, wherein he ſhewed himſelf not inferior to the firſt of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> nor the Conqueror of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:46436:85"/>
                  <p>He undertook to overthrow all the <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the World, to give a new Face to all the Affairs of it, and to deſtroy in a ſhort time the Empire of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> But before he began ſuch a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, he was for paying all the Debts of the Crown, and his own in particular, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all together to near an Hundred Millions; and 'twas a prodigious thing to find ſo much Money, without ſelling the Kingdom, or engaging the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet it is true, that he got this Money, and paid thoſe Debts with it.</p>
                  <p>He was for dividing <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> into Fifteen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Dominations, Five of which ſhould obey Kings that were ſo by <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and Six to be ſubject to Kings that were <hi>Elective,</hi> and the Four remaining ſhould be <hi>Republicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Diviſion he left the <hi>Pope</hi> the Countries belonging to the <hi>Church,</hi> and added thereunto the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> with the Homage of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Italy</hi> modelled into a <hi>Republick;</hi> with Obligation to give the <hi>Pope</hi> every Year a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and Four Thouſand <hi>Sequins.</hi> Only <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> was left in the Condition 'twas in, with its Laws and Cuſtoms. But there were allotted to this <hi>Republick,</hi> Kingdoms and Iſles, which were to be taken from us in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> with an Homage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate of an Embaſſy to kis his Feet, and at the End of every Twenty five Years, a ſmall Statue of Gold, repreſenting St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whom they term <hi>God's Vicar on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flanders</hi> ſhould make a <hi>Republick</hi> with thereſt of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which would be a Loſs for the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and to this <hi>Republick,</hi> ſhould be added ſome of the neighbouring <hi>States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Franche County, Alſatia, Tirol</hi> and <hi>Trante,</hi> were added to the <hi>Democratical</hi> State of the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> with the Homage every Fifteen Years of an Hunting Dog, with a golden Collar about
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46436:85"/>his Neck, faſtned to a Chain of Gold, which this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> ſhould preſent to the Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Emperor ſhould be obliged to renounce the aggrandizing of his Family, and only diſpoſe of vacant <hi>Fiefs,</hi> the Inveſtiture of which he ſhould not beſtow on any of his Kindred; and there ſhould be a Law inviolably obſerved in the <hi>Empire,</hi> That never Two Princes of the ſame Race, ſhould enjoy ſucceſſively the <hi>Imperial</hi> Crown.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould be added to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Provinces belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Title of King of <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould be enlarged with the Principalities of <hi>Tranſylvania, Walachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia:</hi> And the King who was to be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective,</hi> ſhould be choſen by the Suffrages of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>France, England, Spain, Swedeland, Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> ſhould be ſubmitted to the ſame Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>France, England, Spain, Poland, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhould not change their Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when for the general Affairs, theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were to be ſubject to the Univerſal <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> of which the <hi>Pope</hi> was to be the Head.</p>
                  <p>Things thus eſtabliſhed, <hi>Henry</hi> was to be the Umpire of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to decide all Differences which might happen between the aforeſaid Princes and States, with Fifteen Perſons choſen from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt famous for Learning and Arms, which could be found among theſe Fifteen Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and beſides theſe, there was to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a <hi>great Council,</hi> conſiſting of Sixty other Perſons, for all the Differences which might happen in all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Republicks,</hi> between thoſe who govern'd them; and this great Aſſembly ſhould make their Reſidence in the Capital City, <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:46436:86"/>
                  <p>Every State was to be obliged to furniſh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Troops, and Summ of Mony to make War againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the Buſineſs of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Swedeland</hi> ſhould be, to make War to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> There were afterwards Three <hi>Generals</hi> to be choſen by common Conſent for the conquering of <hi>Aſia,</hi> one for the Sea, and Two for the Land; and Three hundred Thouſand Foot entertained, with One hundred and fifty Thouſand Horſe, and Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pieces of Canon; and the Naval Army was to conſiſt of an Hundred and fifty Veſſels, and one Hundred Gallies; and a Fund was to be raiſed for this, of an Hundred Millions of Gold.</p>
                  <p>This Treaſure was to be put into the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Hands; the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi> was to be the Store-houſe of all things belonging to the Sea, the Port of <hi>Meſſina</hi> the Arſenal for the Gallies, and the City of <hi>Metz</hi> one of the principal Magazins for the Land Forces.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes were to be obliged to leſſen their ordinary Expences, and to contribute to this great Deſign according to their Ability.</p>
                  <p>There were to have been ſeveral Spies in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in the Habit of <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectly skill'd in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Languages, to obſerve the Motions of our Empire: And beſides theſe, Forty reſolute Men, who were at a certain Time and Signal to ſet Fire to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and Arſenal, and ſeveral other Quarters of the Town.</p>
                  <p>There was found in this <hi>Hero</hi>'s Cloſet after his Death, a Memorial written with his own Hand, wherein he had already markt Twelve Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for ſeveral Places in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating of ſo great an Affair; and the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> and Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had been already acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this King had an Army
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46436:86"/>already of Forty thouſand Foot, with Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe; and he was, under Petence of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders,</hi> thence to begin the Execution of his Project; affirming, That as to his own part, he had no other Pretenſion but the Glory of delivering <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> from the Tyranny of theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, he applied himſelf for Ten Years together, in ſearching the Means to make his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject take; he gave great Penſions to the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> to ſeveral Officers: and he had in <hi>France,</hi> beſides the Troops I have already mentioned, Four thouſand Gentlemen, who were ſo devoted to him, that they were ready to mount on Horſeback on the leaſt Order from him.</p>
                  <p>He had already Fifteen Millions in the <hi>Baſtil;</hi> and he that had the Superintendancy of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, promiſed to add thereunto in leſs than Three Years Forty other Millions, without touching the ordinary Revenues.</p>
                  <p>I have no knowledge of the Manner how he would divide the Eſtates of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> was aſſaſſinated, juſt as he was ready to leave <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> to begin ſo great a Work; being killed in his Coach in the Arms of his moſt faithful Courtiers: And the Fatal Stroke which carried him out of the World, delivered the Empire of the <hi>true believers;</hi> This Empire whoſe Throne is ſo high, that it reaches up to the <hi>Firſt Heaven,</hi> whence it ſcares the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and ſecures the good <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> from the Inſults of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of theſe old Men I mentioned, has aſſured me, he had heard the King ſpeak theſe following Words, ſome Days before his Death: <hi>I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out of this Town; I know not what with-helds me; I ſhall never accompliſh what I deſign, never ſee the Deſtructiou of</hi> Conſtantinople; <hi>for I am to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46436:87"/>by</hi> Aſtrologers, <hi>I ſhall be kill'd in a Coach. I muſt then always go on Foot, and never ſtir out of</hi> Paris.</p>
                  <p>Such was the End of this Prince, ſo highly venerated by the <hi>French.</hi> He was really a Man of great Courage, and great Penetration; and ſo much the greater, in that he regarded the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, as one of the difficultieſt Things in the World. And truly, no other Prince did that Honour to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor his Succeſſors. But yet not finding his own Forces ſufficient to invade and deſtroy the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he invented a Chymerical Project to find Poſſibility in a Thing which ever appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p>In the very Moment I am Writing, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certain News of my Ruin. If I be not taken off this Time at <hi>Paris,</hi> I ſhall be perhaps more fortunate than ever, and more ſucceſsfully and fully ſerve our great Emperor, whoſe Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is equal to his Grandure, and who is above all the Powers on Earth. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> has ſent for me to come to him; I therefore finiſh this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in haſt, which perhaps will be the laſt I write, being greatly afraid I am diſcovered. If my Fear be vain, I ſhall learn thee in another Letter, the moſt remarkable Events of <hi>Henry</hi>'s Life. In the mean time, I am reſolved, and diſpoſed, to ſuffer the Martyrdom. If I dye, my dear <hi>Egry,</hi> we ſhall ſee one another in the <hi>other World;</hi> if it be true, that we ſhall have Eyes there, and remember what has paſt here below. Pray the great God for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet,</hi> and take Care of thy Health.</p>

                  <head>To the Invincible <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> at the Camp under <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>CArdinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> made me come in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and yet I am alive; he has not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing againſt either Life or Liberty; but has done me the ſame Honour, as to other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Churchmen;</hi> for he believes I am of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> calling me <hi>Titus,</hi> not knowing any more of me than what I told him. It ſeems on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as if he intended me Kindneſſes, ſuppoſing me a bitter Enemy to the <hi>Turks;</hi> and perhaps, I ſhall receive ſome Preſent from him; for, having ſerved him already as an Interpreter, I ſhall tell thee, Invincible <hi>Vizier,</hi> what has paſt between him and me, without any Fear of being tedious to thee. I ſerve thee faithfully, and write to thee as oft as my Duty requires.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I was in his Cloſet, he thus ſpoke to me; <hi>Titus, What doſt thou do in</hi> Paris; <hi>what Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs haſt thou in this Town; and what is really thy Country?</hi> I anſwered him, <hi>That I was a poor Clerk of</hi> Moldavia, <hi>and came to ſtudy Divinity and be a Prieſt;</hi> that <hi>I knew no better Place to become Wiſe and Learned,</hi> and that <hi>I would willingly ſacrifice all Things to render him Service.</hi> He afterwards askt me, <hi>Whether I was acquainted with any of the</hi> Eaſtern <hi>Languages,</hi> and, <hi>Whether I had ever been at</hi> Conſtontinople? <hi>I have been,</hi> replyed I, <hi>in this great Town when I was a Child,</hi> and, <hi>that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother were then in Slavery. My Father is dead, and my Mother is Married again to a</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Greek; <hi>I underſtand</hi> Arabic <hi>and</hi> Turkiſh, <hi>and am perfectly skill'd in the School</hi>-Greek. <hi>What do
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46436:88"/>you mean by School</hi>-Greek? reply'd the <hi>Cardinal: It is different from the Vulgar</hi>-Greek, anſwered I, <hi>which is ſo corrupted, that learned People will not give themſelves the Trouble to underſtand it.</hi> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bade me go into a little Cloſet, where I ſhould find one of his Secretaries, who would need my Help; where I had no ſooner entred, but the Secretary preſented me with a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Manuſcript, to turn into <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> if I could not do it into <hi>French.</hi> I immediately tranſlated it into <hi>Latin,</hi> and will now inform thee (wiſe Miniſter, and Governor of the great Empire of the <hi>true Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>) of the Contents of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Derviſes,</hi> called in <hi>France Cordeliers,</hi> keep, as thou knoweſt, in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Sepulchre of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> by a Privilege which <hi>Zelim</hi> the Conqueror of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> granted them. Theſe <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> have neither Peace nor Truce with the <hi>Greek Chriſtians,</hi> and they have ſuch Difference together, as are of ill Conſequences to all; they perſecute one another without ceaſing, and ſpread abroad moſt bitter <hi>Satyrs</hi> againſt each other. Each Party makes ill Reports to his <hi>Superior</hi> of that which is oppoſite, and mixes among ſome Truths, a great many Lyes and abſurd Stories. But it appears to me, That the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who naturally love Cabals, and have the Reputation of great Romancers, are more dexterous than their adverſe Party to do Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Derviſes</hi> have repreſented a great many things to this <hi>Cardinal,</hi> to authoriſe their Pretenſions againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by Means of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador. They not only reproach the <hi>Greeks</hi> with ſeveral Injuſtices and Violences, but accuſe the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s of Cruelty and Tyranny, and the Souldiers which guard <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of inſupportable Exactions. Thou ſhouldeſt be throughly informed whether theſe Complaints be on juſt Grounds; for,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46436:88"/>they affirm, their Patience is beyond the Cruelty of the Officers thou employeſt; yet, that they can no longer ſuffer the inſolencies which are now put on them, and are on the Point of hazarding all by a Stroak of Deſpair. It does not belong to me, to be Advocate in the Behalf of thoſe who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy Authority, and eſpecially of thoſe who ought to bear the Yoke of the <hi>Mahometans;</hi> but, 'tis the Duty of <hi>Mahmut,</hi> thy Creature, to inform thee of the true Circumſtances of Affairs which come to his Knowledge. Yet, if the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Derviſes</hi> be ſo great as they make it, thou that art the true Light which enlightens the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and ſcattereſt the Darkneſs of it; thou wilt not permit thoſe that live under the Publick Faith to be oppreſt; and that Four wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Greeks</hi> ſhall be the Cauſe of ſuch Diſorders as may happen in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the Complaints of which have reached the Ears of the greateſt Princes in <hi>Europe;</hi> and to whom ſuch things may give falſe <hi>Idea's</hi> of the Government of thoſe who are choſen by God to command all the World. Invincible <hi>Baſſa,</hi> I have diſcovered the true Circumſtances of this Affair, in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Manuſcript which Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu's</hi> Secretary has put into my Hands. I have fully diſcovered the falſe Reaſonings of the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> who by common Conſent, have offered ſeveral Things to the moſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Mufti,</hi> which I am ſure thou wilt not approve of; for they make moſt wretched Excuſes, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour over their Perfidiouſneſs. They ſay, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> ought to be ill uſed, on purpoſe to get rid of them from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> being, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemies in their Hearts to the Welfare of the <hi>Empire;</hi> That the Time of the Privileges granted by <hi>Zelim</hi> and his Succeſſors is expired, and that moreover, 'tis a great Imprudence to ſuffer Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims to come over from diſtant Countries, who
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46436:89"/>under Pretence of viſiting the <hi>Holy Sepulchre,</hi> and other Places, which Superſtition has conſecrated in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> come to eſpy the Actions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> examin the Form of their Government, viſit their Places, and meaſure the Roads and Ports which they poſſeſs on the Seas, which may prove of diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Honour and Intereſt of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. I cannot inform thee, how this <hi>Memoir</hi> came into <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Hands, but it was either ſold or intercepted at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. However, I muſt not forget to tell thee one Remark which this Miniſter made, whence thou maiſt gueſs, whether he reaſoned like a wiſe and prudent Man: <hi>Were I,</hi> ſays he <hi>the</hi> Sultan's <hi>chief Miniſter, I ſhould have added Privilege to Privilege, to the</hi> Monks Cordeliers, <hi>not only becauſe Juſtice requires it, but by reaſon of the Advantage which might redound thereby to the</hi> Turks. <hi>I would make the Ways to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>eaſie to all People; I would leſſen the Tribute; the Pilgrims ſhould be well uſed; the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in general, as well as the</hi> Cordeliers; <hi>and I would ſeverely puniſh the Officers and Soldiers who guard</hi> Paleſtine, <hi>and the</hi> ſacred Places, <hi>if they did otherwiſe.</hi> And then turning himſelf towards me, <hi>Does it not appear to thee,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the beſt way to enlarge a Kingdom, is, to procure it an Advantage which increaſes the Number of its Subjects? 'Tis not enough that the Prince ſhews the Ornaments of his Principality, he muſt ſhew alſo the Prince, otherwiſe he will be like the</hi> Philoſopher <hi>who was brought into</hi> Herod<hi>'s Preſence. I do not ſee,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>any Thing elſe but the Beard and Cloak of a</hi> Philoſopher. <hi>If the</hi> Turks <hi>do as the</hi> Scythians. <hi>When they made themſelves Maſters of</hi> Athens, <hi>they will do better; for they would not burn the Books which were gathered together in this Famous Town, alledging, that thoſe who applied themſelves to Study, were not wont to do any great Hurt. If the</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46436:89"/>
                     <hi>meditate on Death, in viſiting and honouring the Sepulchres; the</hi> Muſſulmen <hi>ſhould conſider, that if they make War againſt them, they have only to do with contrite and penitent Perſons who will therefore be the more eaſily defeated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is a Faithful and exact Account of the Converſation I had with this chief Miniſter of State. Suffer now that I add, as a Note of the Juſtice of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Pretenſions, what ſome Particulars of this Kingdom have given me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, touching the Juſtice and Antiquity of the Privileges of the <hi>Religious Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They make appear, That for above Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years theſe Places do belong to the <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> That, <hi>Robert d' Anjou</hi> bought them of the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and made thereof a Preſent to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and put them in Poſſeſſion, not only of the <hi>Holy Sepulchre,</hi> but of <hi>Calvary,</hi> of <hi>Bethlchem,</hi> and their Dependancies; which Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laſted till <hi>Zelim</hi> I who therein confirm'd the <hi>Religious Chriſtians,</hi> with an Augmentation of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, as ſoon as ever he had conquered <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>

                  <p>Thy humble Slave <hi>Mahmut,</hi> has an unpleaſant Task impoſed on him by this <hi>French</hi> Miniſter. He deſired me to give him ſome <hi>Memoir</hi> in general of what I know, and bad me not wonder at his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; it being his Maxim, to make Friendſhip with all Strangers of Merit, whereby he has learnt ſeveral important Matters, and diſcovered Secrets of great Importance; and, that it lay in my power to oblige him greatly, in giving him an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and where they lay moſt open to be attackt. I anſwered him very modeſtly, That my Buſineſs being only to ſay my <hi>Breviary,</hi> he could not expect any great Capacity from me in theſe Matters. He ſmiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bade me try what I could do in that Matter; yet however, he would not lay any Thing upon me which might make me uneaſie; adding, That tho he were a <hi>Cardinal</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> yet he knew ſomething more than Divinity, and that ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates had made War with great Succeſs from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair. In fine, I could not but promiſe to gratifie him; and thou ſhalt know, in due time, how I diſcharged my ſelf, for I ſhall rather part with my Life, than act contrary to my Allegiance; however, I muſt avoid giving him Cauſe to ſuſpect me, and acquaint thee alone with the Conferences I have had with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> multiply thy Line, that the Empire may not want Miniſters of thy Linage; and, the Great God ſo aſſiſt thy Valour, that thou maiſt ſee the Empire of <hi>Amurath</hi> without Bounds.</p>

                  <p>THE Winter is ſo far advanced, that the King's Armies lie quiet.

                     <hi>To</hi> Bekir Baſſa, <hi>Chief Treaſurer to the</hi> Grand Seignior.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ELiachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> whom thou thoughteſt ſo wiſe, and vertuous a Man, concealed his ill Qualities at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to diſcover 'em more advantageouſly at <hi>Paris.</hi> It was not his fault, that my Affairs were not intirely ruined. The Villain gave Marks of his Treachery, in the very Moment he ſaw me receive the Mony from <hi>Carcon</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> upon thy Order. I wrote to thee, I thought this Man would be faithful in inſtructing me in the Things which were neceſſary for me to know, and that I would be upon my Guard in thoſe Things wherein he might do me Miſchief. Thou maiſt eaſily imagin, how I am vexed at preſent; for I can neither accuſe him, nor draw from him a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. He made me believe, That a Lawyer's Son at <hi>Paris,</hi> a young Man of great Hopes, having received ſome Diſpleaſure from his Relations, was reſolved to be Circumciſed, and embrace the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Religion; and that he would not loſe ſo happy an Occaſion of doing me Service; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had contrived to hide this young Man, in a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46436:91"/>cloſe Cellar, underneath the Houſe where I lodge, without diſcovering to him the Place where he ſhould be. He added, he had promiſed him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to procure him a conſiderable Employ in <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and that he had in fine, fill'd him with all the Hopes which are wont to be given to thoſe that through Fickleneſs, or temporal Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, forſake the Religion of their Fathers, to profeſs another. He alſo aſſured me, I ſhould have no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by this Buſineſs, having taken all neceſſary Care to tranſport his Convert immediately to <hi>Tunis</hi> or <hi>Algiers,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Reaſons he alledged, and this young Man was brought in the Night to the Houſe where I lay, and hid without my ſeeing him. But the next Day was not opened without a ſtrange <hi>Scene</hi> in the Houſe. I was aſtoniſhed to ſee a Woman in a great Rage ſtand before me, demanding Satisfaction for violating her Daughter, and taking away her Life; charging me, with having forcibly carried her away, and then Murthered her; and ſhe made me all theſe Reproaches, in the Company of a great many Officers of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Think then the Confuſion I was in; the more I denied the Crime, the more fiercely they charged it on me. I was threatned with Death, if I did not confeſs it, and give the Satisfaction required of me; and at the ſame time, this ſly <hi>Jezabel</hi> gave a Sign to one of the Rogues her Companions, to go down to ſuch a Place, and bring up her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was found alive, in Man's Cloaths, and melted into Tears. It ſignified nothing, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Reaſons, to prove my Innocency; ſo that I was forced at laſt to throw out to theſe hungry Wretches, all the Mony I had; and they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew not, till they had abuſed and reviled me, in a moſt bitter manner. They got from me about an Hundred and Eighty four Sequins of Gold,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46436:92"/>and about an Hundred Piaſters of Silver. <hi>Eliachim</hi> has the Confidence to affirm, he knew nothing of the Cheat; and thinks to juſtify himſelf in ſaying, That if he who is a <hi>Jew</hi> was deceived by this young Man, who pretended to become a <hi>Turk;</hi> there were a Thouſand <hi>French</hi> People, who had been cheated in like manner. I ſhall not here mention what I alledged to him to make him own his Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs, this being fruitleſs. On the other Hand, reflecting on the Employ I had, and my preſent Circumſtances; it appeared to me neceſſary, to diſſemble this truth; and to wait for ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Occaſion, to ſend this Villain out of <hi>Paris;</hi> and to lay ſome Snare for him at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I give thee notice of this Event, for Two Reaſons; that I may have more Money, and provide for my Safety; believing my ſelf in great Danger, as long as I live where ſuch a Fellow comes. I ſhall not mention the Intereſts of <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Life; for I ſhall ever think it well ſpent, ſhould it be loſt in the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Service, who is the only Prop of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not want Opportunities, wherein thou maiſt draw out of <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Purſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he has robbed me of; neither wilt thou want Means to remove from me ſo dangerous a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Thou ſhouldeſt know, what the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are always irreconciliable Enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſay of them. They affirm, That theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Wretches, are the Slaves of all Nations, excepting <hi>Turkey,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they are Maſters; they are at the ſame, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed and curſt; in the midſt of Abundance, they appear always miſerable; and yet they lay Hands on all others Properties. They add, that they be Vagabonds like <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> yet in whatever Place they are, they find a Country like <hi>Homer;</hi> That they are all perfidious, and, in Publick, affect to appear
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46436:92"/>religious, but live in grievous Diſorder and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their own Houſes, ſticking at no ſort of Crimes; bragging, that tho it be not permitted them to purchaſe Lands, yet they have found means to get into their Hands, a great part of the Gold in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo ſay, their Number muſt needs be great, ſeeing they never go to War; and there are none amongſt them that do not marry. They are, ſay they, ever Cowards and Paltroons where there's any Danger or Pains; but bold, when they foreſee any certain Gain in the Markets they make. They never ſpeak the Truth, but when 'tis to deceive; they are ever Lyers, and there's no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety or Sacrilege at which they will ſcruple; and theſe ſame <hi>Chriſtians</hi> affirm, they will commit one time or other, ſome horrid Crime in our great <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> City; being the <hi>Turks</hi> concealed Enemies, though they put great Confidence in them; and that we are willing to be deceived by them. I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Carcoa,</hi> to ſend me ſpeedily ſome Aſſiſtance; and I have been forced to borrow Mony of this ſame <hi>Eliachim,</hi> that Traitor who has brought me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Condition I am in; he could not deny me, tho he pleads (like a Rogue as he is) extream Poverty.</p>
                  <p>This Trick which has been put upon me, will oblige me henceforward to keep a <hi>Vallet,</hi> but I will take one ſo little, that no Man ſhall reproach me with chooſing <hi>much</hi> of an <hi>ill</hi> Thing. Abandon not the poor <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who prays God that he would give thee all ſorts of Proſperities, and make thee live in perfect Health; and wiſhes, that all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the <hi>Infidel</hi> Nations, may become Slaves to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who ſhall be ever Invincible; and that their Riches may increaſe the Treaſure thou guardeſt.</p>

                  <p>I Have received the Mony thou dideſt ſend me and immediately loſt it; yet without my Fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Bekïr</hi> the Treaſurer, has been informed by my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of the Loſs I ſuſtained, and of another Affair which is not neceſſary for thee to know: I alſo writ to him, I expected a ſpeedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Supply from thee; for I ſhould demand it of thee. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Intereſt requires, that thou doſt not oblige me to give thee any other Reaſon, and that thou defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not to ſend me, as ſoon as may be, a ſufficient Sum of Mony. I can only inform thee, that in the Attempt which was made on me, I loſt only what I can recover. My Life is in Safety, and by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle my Affairs are in the ſame Condition; for, no body has, as yet, diſcovered who I am. If thou writeſt any thing to <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> be ſure be careful, and do not truſt him more than needs.</p>
                  <p>Send without loſs of Time to the <hi>Port</hi> the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket I addreſs'd to thee, and let me not languiſh in <hi>Paris</hi> in the Expectation of Mony. 'Tis true, Gold is a rare Commodity, becauſe every Body deſires it. In this great Town of <hi>Paris, one may ſooner find an hundred Saints, than one liberal Perſon.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſay, it belongs only to Sots to be free of their Mony; that a Man ſhould ſuccour his Friend with good Counſel, and there's no need of anything elſe. Learn, <hi>Carcoa,</hi> to have no need of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Help, and have a care of being too free.

                     <hi>BIrkabeb</hi>'s Father, was a Rich Man in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and his Vertue was equal to his Riches. He had Nineteen Children, who all dyed of the ſame Diſtemper, when they arrived to ſome Years. Never Family was more united, and regular. <hi>Birkabeb</hi> was naturally of a quiet, ſoft Temper, but ſo holy a Man, and at laſt dyed ſo poor, that a Thief coming into his Chamber one Night to ſteal, and finding nothing, he called him to him, whilſt he was going away, and gave him his Bed, as not being willing he ſhould depart empty handed, and loſe his Labour. Being forced after this to lye on the Floor, he received Aſſiſtance from Heaven by the Hands of his Wife; and ſcarce were Twenty Moons paſt ſince this Adventure, but there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened another more ſtrange than the former; for he became on a ſuddain very Rich; <hi>and at the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46436:94"/>ſame Inſtant ceaſed to be wiſe.</hi> He had a Wife of as haughty a Diſpoſition, and noiſy Humour, as his was quiet and humble. This Woman kept the Flocks, and with a florid Youthfulneſs, was endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Beauty; and 'tis not known by what Accident a Prince of the Race of the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> who fled from his Sovereigns-Diſpleaſure, met with her. 'Tis certain, that having recommended himſelf to her, and intreated her to ſave his Life, and not diſcover him, ſhe led him into a very thick Wood, which was never frequented; where the Prince lived for Fourteen Years concealed; but growing at length tired with this ſort of Life, he perſwaded this Woman to go to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> diſguiſed in Mans Apparel, and find <hi>Arſamus,</hi> who had been his Covernor, and was a faithful and wiſe Man; who would give her Mony and Jewels, and a Water, which would ſo diſguiſe his Countenance, that his neareſt Friends could not know him; by which means he might hold on his Way to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> as he had determined. This Woman ſoon arrived at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> with the Princes Tokens; which were ſome ſtrange Characters, and a Ring, which he uſually wore; which <hi>Arſamus</hi> knowing, he intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with a conſiderable Sum, and ſeveral Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, together with a little Golden Pot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was this Water before mentioned. This Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger returning in leſs than Forty Days Time, found the Prince dead in the <hi>Grotto</hi> where he withdrew, with a Paper in his Hand, wherein he intreated the firſt which Chance ſhould bring thither, to bury his Body at the Foot of a fair Oak near by; and alſo intreated the Party which had his Ring, to carry it to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> and beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Offence he had given him. <hi>Birkabeb</hi>'s Wife then diſcovered to him all that had hapned; led him into the Wood; ſhewed him the dead Prince, the Letter, the Ring and the precious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:46436:94"/>Stones; and only reſerved to herſelf the Secret of the Water, which ſhe would not intruſt him with. Having after this reſolved to go to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> they went together, by whom they were well received, and laden with Riches. <hi>Birkabeb</hi> took up his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> tarrying there Four Years, and there led a voluptuous and diſhoneſt Life. Whilſt his Wife leaving him, ran away with a Young <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> and made ſeveral different Voyages into <hi>Aſia,</hi> under ſeveral Figures; and by means of the Water which ſhe had received of <hi>Arſamus,</hi> ſhe deceived her Husband, and as many Lovers as ſhe pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy <hi>Birkabeb</hi> being by his Wife's Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs become again Poor, reſolved at laſt to return into his own Country, where he died in his Houſe full of Years, and in ſuch Repute for Holineſs, that the common Report is, he wrought divers Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. He left Four Sons, of which I knew only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baber,</hi> who is he thou mentioneſt in thy Letter. And this is all I can tell thee of <hi>Birkabeb,</hi> of his Son, and Grand-Son <hi>Ababer,</hi> whom I look upon as a very honeſt Man, and in whom I believe thou maiſt put Confidence; yet with this Reflection, That he which is Honeſt now, may ceaſe to be ſo. Salute this Perſon from me, and continue to love me; anſwer my firſt Letter, if thou haſt not done it; and this laſt alſo, if it be not too troubleſom to thee. Farewell.</p>

                  <head>LETTER XX.</head>
                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Egry Boynou, <hi>the white</hi> Eunuch.</head>
                  <p>I Am ſtill alive, and in Health; my Fear has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vain, and I have eſcaped the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Hands without any Danger; which will make me hope the ſame good Fortune, ſhould he ever ſend for me again. But thou ſhalt not know his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with me, that being a Secret I am obliged to conceal.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt, I hope, received the long Letter I wrote thee, containing ſeveral Particulars of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV's Life. I ſend thee now ſeveral of his Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which may be termed Sentences. Read them with Attention, they are as pleaſant as profitable for <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Uſe; who will find this great King, to have had an Invincible Courage in Adverſity, and great Clemency and Generoſity, when he was in his Proſperity; he was Valour it ſelf amongſt the Souldiers, Wife and Pleaſant amongſt his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, terrible in Battles, eaſy and free amongſt the Ladies, full of Heat when any Action offered it ſelf, and Courteous and Affable to all ſorts of Reople.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> dyed in the ſame Manner as moſt of our <hi>Sultans,</hi> that is to ſay, a Violent Death. He had lived Fifty Seven Years and ſome Months, and reigned about Twenty Years. Several of his Courtiers named him, like the Firſt <hi>Caeſar, All Womens Husband;</hi> becauſe 'twas believed he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any that he fancied, but he obtained her. He had Fourteen Children, Six by the Queen, and the others by Four of his Miſtriſſes. She who was called the <hi>beautiful Gabrielle,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Eſtree,</hi> ſeemed to have more Power on his Heart
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46436:95"/>than all others; he often carried her about with him in his Army, and to the Places he beſieged in Perſon. <hi>Henry</hi> was wont to ſay, 'Twas as difficult to know how to Love well, to prepare a Feaſt, and to dance at the ſame time agreeably, as to draw up an Army for Battle, conſiſting of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And when he was more advanced in Years, he ſaid, He loved Dancing, for it made him appear Young. He loved Play, for it ſhewed he could be angry; and Ladies, becauſe he ſaid he believed a Man ought to love all the Days of his Life.</p>
                  <p>He was ſo impatient at Play, when he loſt, that he ſeemed to be as much concerned at the Loſs of an Hundred Crowns, as at the taking of a City from him.</p>
                  <p>He often diſguiſed himſelf like a Peaſant, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his Miſtriſſes, without being known; and he has often carried on this Humour to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to drive Aſſes laden with Fruit, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carry a Truſs of Hay on his Shoulders.</p>
                  <p>When he was peaceably ſetled in his Kingdom, he ſaid to thoſe who were his greateſt Intimates, That he that grew weary at Difficulties, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe Things which might be acquired without Trouble. I ſaw my ſelf a King, ſaid he, without having a Kingdom, an Husband without a Wife, a Captain without Souldiers, and Liberal without having any thing to give. I have had in fine, a Kingdom, Children in lawful Marriage, my Troops are numerous, and I can diſpoſe of ſeveral Millions.</p>
                  <p>This Prince has been wounded ſeveral Times, has received Three Wounds in the Wars, and Three others on his Throne, in the Calms of Peace. The Actions which have gained him moſt Glory, have been, the winning of Four Battles whence he came out Conqueror, having very few
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46436:96"/>Troops, and his Enemy having very numerous Armies; the general Peace he gave to <hi>Europe;</hi> the Reconciliation of the <hi>Venetians</hi> with the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, which had excommunicated them; and the great Project I ſpake to thee about in my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Letter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio</hi> having one Day asked him, How long he had made War; his Anſwer was, All the Days of his Life; and my Armies have never had any other <hi>General,</hi> but my ſelf. He was ſeen once for Forty Hours together on Horſe-back, and he led at that Time an unhappy Life, yet he bore up with invincible Courage, which made his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers call him the <hi>King of Iron.</hi> At the ſame time he held a Morſel of courſe Bread in one Hand, he would with the other form on the Ground the Deſign of an Entrenchment; and when he would ſhew his Friends the fineſt Gallery of his Palace, he would at the ſame time, lead them down into his Stables to ſee his Horſes. He was wont to ſay, That <hi>a King who would reign happily, muſt not do all things which he may.</hi> He had ſuch a Greatneſs of Mind, and was ſo merciful, That he pardoned thoſe who conſpired againſt his Life. He ſhewed oft to thoſe that were about him, a Souldier that was a Stranger, and had wounded him in a Battle; whom he recompenſed for doing his Duty, and made him one of his Guards.</p>
                  <p>Tho he was not Learned, yet he read Books of his Religion, and took a ſingular Pleaſure in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and converſing with learned Men. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Night the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt half aſleep in his Bed; he bade his Reader continue his Reading, for he would ſleep no more that Night.</p>
                  <p>Having laid Siege to a moſt important Place, in a moſt cold Seaſon, he ſlipt one Night wrapt up in his Cloak to the Places where the Labourers were
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46436:96"/>at Work, and heard a Souldier there curſing both God and him; yet without concerning himſelf any further, he whiſper'd in this Souldier's Ear, <hi>God hears thee, and the King too, for all thou knoweſt; if thou canſt not Work, hold thy Peace, and be gone.</hi> The Night following, the King ſetting to work himſelf, to excite others; he cauſed this Souldier to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, and thus ſpake to him, <hi>Help me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Earth, and do not ſwear, for now the King hears thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To correct the Vices, the Injuſtices and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of others, he did not uſe Leſſons, but gave Examples. And one day, that he heard one of his Captains in a Rage, for that his Creditors had ſeized on all he had, to his Horſe and Sword; he thus ſpake to him: <hi>I that am thy Sovereign have paid my Debts, and ſold all that I am worth for that End; and thou that art my Subject, ought to do the ſame thing, without murmuring:</hi> And then taking him apart, he gave him ſome Jewels to help him out.</p>
                  <p>He often ſhewed the <hi>Marſhal de Biron</hi> to his Friends, and thus ſpake to them about this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; <hi>This Man knows to Act, as well as Talk; and I have a great Love for him.</hi> Yet he ſometime after cauſed him to be put to Death, having Three times pardoned his Diſloyalty: This Captain having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Plots againſt his Life, and againſt the State; yet remembring he had loved him, he would ſpare one part of the ſhame of his Puniſhment, and therefore ordered he ſhould be executed in Priſon.</p>
                  <p>A Scholar, Two <hi>Monks,</hi> and a Fool, attempted at ſeveral times to kill him; and, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told thee, he was ſeveral times wounded, and at laſt, received a Mortal Stroke. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had undertaken to Poiſon him, was burnt alive; and this fooliſh Creature ſaid at
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46436:97"/>her Death, thinking to leſſen her Crime; <hi>That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving foreſeen the King was to have been Stab'd to Death by the Hand of a Ruffian, ſhe would therefore procure him a more eaſie and honourable Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> extreamly loved Hunting, and one day being in purſuit of a Stag, and far diſtant from his Company, a great <hi>Spectrum</hi> appeared to him with a black and terrible Countenance, with all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage of a Hunter, having a Leaſe of Dogs, and ſaid theſe words to him in a diſmal Tone; <hi>Expect me, and hear me, repent and amend thy Life; doſt thou underſtand me?</hi> Thou maiſt eaſily believe, this <hi>Viſion</hi> did not a little diſturb him. Yet he was more troubled, at what a Peaſant one day told him, who ſpake to him with great Freedom; and his Diſcourſe gave him that Diſturbance, which he could never get rid of. This Man talk'd to the Prince often with great Familiarity, when he found him in the Field; and one day held this Diſcourſe to him: <hi>We are here Two Men; thou art a great King, and I a poor Peaſant; yet I am perhaps a better Man, becauſe I am more Innocent; I have ſaid all the good I can of thy Perſon to my Friends, being ſenſible of thy Juſtice, thy Bounty and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But all theſe Vertues are horribly ſoiled by a grievous Vice, which God will never forgive thee unleſs thou leaveſt it off; thou committeſt great Prince, continual Adulteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, this Prince acknowledged to ſome of his Confidents, That he had that day heard in particular a Preacher, who without any skill in <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> had more moved him, than all the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> put together could do. This <hi>Sorbon</hi> is a <hi>College</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> famous for <hi>Learned Divines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince put a pleaſant Trick on his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> who often urged him to forſake his Miſtriſſes, and content himſelf with the Embraces of his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46436:97"/>Wife: He ordered a Cook, who was wont to dreſs this <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Victuals, to give him nothing every Meal but Partridges; which ſo greatly tired him, that he could not forbear complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King himſelf, that this Cook was ſo wilful and humourſom, that he would let him have nothing but Partridges; ſo that he grew ſo weary with that kind of Food, as made him ſick at the Thoughts of it; the Prince only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him; <hi>Always the Queen, always Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He loved Learned Men, and was a great Patron of them; yet he ſaid, that Neceſſity obliged him to follow Arms, but had he been left to his own Inclination, he ſhould have choſen to have been a Scholar.</p>
                  <p>He had no great Eſteem for <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving theſe Kind of People wiſh ill to Men; being of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Mind, who thought that a Man of Thirty Years of Age, needed them not.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, he moſt eſteemed <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,</hi> and gave Penſions to ſeveral of them in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and other Places; ſaying oft, That if any one could find the Books of <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> which are wanting, and thoſe of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that he would willingly beſtow on him the ſame Gift of Three Cities, which <hi>Xerxes</hi> made to a <hi>Greek</hi> Captain, the one for Bread, the Second for Wine, and the Third for Cloathing. And therefore there are above Fifty Authors, who have written his Hiſtory. He envied <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by reaſon of the Happineſs of having ſo many Learned Men in his Reign; and, that he more eſteemed <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> living a peaceable Citizen at <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Alexander,</hi> triumphing over all <hi>Aſia;</hi> and, That <hi>Mecaenas</hi>'s patronizing and recompenſing Illuſtrious Men that excelled in <hi>Rome</hi> in all Arts,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46436:98"/>had rendred his Name Immortal, together with that of his Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>He bewailed the great Pains he had taken, to obtain the Command of others, and for his having learnt nothing himſelf; affirming, It had been better for him to have learnt to command him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He was alſo wont to ſay, That a Wiſe Prince ought never to refuſe a Peace, unleſs it be found more prejudicial than War.</p>
                  <p>Being one Day converſing with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador, he began to walk very faſt; and perceiving the Aſtoniſhment of this Miniſter; <hi>You ſee,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I can ſtill mount on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and march on Foot too if it be neceſſary, and that the Gout has not deprived me of the uſe of my Legs.</hi> His Valour was ſo admirable, that a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> being at a Ceremony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sword of this Prince was carried naked before him, he ſtopt openly him that carried it, and kiſt it, ſaying, He did this Honour to the Sword of the firſt and chiefeſt Captain of the World.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> one Day preſented him with a Receipt to change Lead into Gold; to whom he anſwered, in making a great empty Coffer to be brought to him; <hi>When thou haſt filled this Coffer with the Metal thou talkeſt of, come to me, and I will give thee as much Lead as thou wilt have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being at <hi>Fountain-Bleau,</hi> a Place famous ſince ſeveral Ages, and ſhewing all the Buildings there to a foreign Prince, who told him, when he had ſhewed him the Chapel, <hi>That he had lodged</hi> God <hi>in too narrow a Compaſs:</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>was better lodged in the Heart, than in great Edifices of Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he drew the Deſigns againſt the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> which I mentioned in my other Letter,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46436:98"/>he did an Action of Generoſity very beneficial to the <hi>Moors,</hi> who were driven out of <hi>Spain;</hi> permitting above Fifty thouſand Men, who had paſt the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> to embark themſelves in the Ports of <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Africk.</hi> I cannot call to mind that Time, without bewailing the Loſs of a Million of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who periſhed by diverſe Accidents and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                  <p>After a Battle, wherein <hi>Henry</hi> ran a great Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; he ſaid, <hi>He had often fought for Victory, but at this Time he fought for his Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had uſed more Boots thon Shooes, and he vaunted he had been leſs Time in Bed, than the Duke of <hi>Magenne</hi> had been at Table; this latter commanding then the Army of the <hi>League.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This King deſired to be thought a real Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Subjects; he therefore applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſearching the Means of redreſſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Abuſes of the Barr; but, he advanced not much in the Buſineſs, whatever Care he uſed; it being impoſſible for him to bridle the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and to hinder the Length of Suits, or correct the Injuſtice of <hi>Judges,</hi> to leave nothing to be done by his Succeſſors. He ſeemed to be much troubled many times, when he ſpake of theſe kind of Things, in that there were in <hi>Paris</hi> more Courts and Lawyers than in all the vaſt Empire of the <hi>Turks;</hi> his Deſign being, after the Example of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> to make all Suits, which were everlaſting, by the Knavery of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> to be decided in Three Days. And he therefore deſigned alſo to burn the Books of all thoſe, who had written infinite Commentaries on this Subject; which ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ruin the People, and cauſed often Times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Relations, Friends, and Neighbours, ſuch Broils, as may be ſaid to do more Miſchief
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46436:99"/>than a Civil War. He affirmed, That in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting herein the <hi>Turks,</hi> he ſhould uſe his Subjects as his real Children, and hinder them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another; That he would cauſe ſharp Nails and Raſors to be faſtened to the Seats where the Judges ſate, that thoſe who ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be corrupted, might ſit thereon; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in this particular, I cannot but wonder at the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Blindneſs.</p>
                  <p>We ſee oftentimes decided in one only Campaign, the Differences of Two great States; but a Suit in Law for Twenty Sequins ſhall often laſt a Mans whole Life, and perhaps be entailed on his Heirs.</p>
                  <p>But hear a remarkable Example of the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Sovereign. There were who would have perſwaded him to have apprehended the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who came to <hi>Paris,</hi> to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſome Differences he had with him. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe that adviſed him with this, <hi>That</hi> Francis I. <hi>one of his Predeceſſors, had learnt him, A Prince was more obliged to do what he had promiſed, than to obtain what he deſired; that 'twas in his Power to have apprehended a Prince far more conſiderable, but would not do it, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Emperor</hi> Charles V. <hi>to paſs out of his Kingdom, who had come therein on his Word; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this,</hi> added he, <hi>ſhall</hi> Henry <hi>give ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to Princes? If the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>has often broke his Word with me, it does not therefore follow I muſt imitate him; Crimes can never be authoriſed by Examples.</hi> The ſame Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having asked him, <hi>What Revenue he drew from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> He anſwered him in theſe Terms, <hi>I draw as much as I will, becauſe I make my ſelf beloved; whence it is, that my Subjects count all our Eſtates are common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwered very pleaſantly, to a Prince's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46436:99"/>who came with a Complement of Condole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the Death of his Son, who had been dead near a Year; <hi>That he was no longer grieved at that Loſs, ſeeing</hi> God <hi>had given him Two more ſince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Captain of great Reputation having ſaid, <hi>That the Kings Liberalities, tho ſeveral Times rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, could not oblige him to love him; Henry</hi> ſent him Word, <hi>He would heap ſo many Favours on him, that he would force him at laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He oft uſed this Proverb, <hi>That more Flyes are taken with a Drop of Hony, than a Tun of Vinegar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Monk</hi> entertaining him one Day about Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs; <hi>Open your</hi> Breviary, <hi>Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ſhew me, where you learnt theſe fine Leſſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Day a Taylor preſenting him with a Book of <hi>Politicks,</hi> he ſaid to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who was there preſent; Monſieur Chancellor, <hi>cut me out a Suit of Cloths, here's a Taylor who underſtands your Trade, and tells me how I ſhall govern my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Day when the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Nuncio,</hi> was at a great Feaſt, where there were between Twenty and Thirty Ladies of great Beauty, he told this Prelate, <hi>He had been in ſeveral Battels; but never found himſelf in ſo great Danger before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing ſeems more agreeable, than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he made to the <hi>Provoſt</hi> of the Merchants of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was urgent with him to conſent to an Impoſt, which was to be laid on the Fountains of the Town, to furniſh the Expence of Forty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who came into <hi>France</hi> to renew their ancient Alliance with this Kingdom; and his Anſwer was, That this Magiſtrate ſhould find ſome other Expedient, than to change Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine; which was a Miracle that never any Body wrought but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is, as thou knoweſt, the <hi>Chriſtian's Saviour;</hi> and for thy further Inſtruction, 'tis neceſſary for thee to know,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46436:100"/>The <hi>Switzers</hi> love Wine above all Things in the World, and that not without Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This Prince went to the Wars at the Age of Fifteen, and at Seventeen killed an Enemy; and in the Year following, he ſaved the Life of one of his Captains, and had his Horſe killed under him. He was in Five Battles, and in more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Combats, and at the Siege of above Two hundred Places. He ſuſtained Seven different Wars, in which his Enemies aknowledged, that he had Fifty five Armies upon him at ſeveral Times, and in different Places; and always obtained ſome conſiderable Advantage.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have given him the Term of <hi>Great,</hi> have given him his true Name. He was highly eſteemed by all Nations, and thou knoweſt very well, that our <hi>Sultans,</hi> tho the mightieſt Monarchs in the Univerſe, have admired this great Prince's Fortune and Valour.</p>
                  <p>Above Fifty <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> have written his Life; above Five hundred <hi>Poets</hi> have publiſhed his Praiſes.</p>
                  <p>I will leave thee at preſent, the Liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this King with thoſe, whom thou wilt chooſe from amongſt the <hi>Hero</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Mahomet</hi> XI. has not done more than him, he may be compared to him in Warlike Actions, with this Difference, That King <hi>Henry</hi> conquered the <hi>Gauls</hi> who were of his Patrimony, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> conquered Twelve Kingdoms and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, becauſe he was perſwaded, that all the Earth belonged to him. <hi>Henry</hi> ſubdued the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> left an infinite Number of Marks behind him of his <hi>Grandure,</hi> on Marble, and in the Writings of famous Authors; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> left only on his Tomb, thoſe which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46436:100"/>ſhewed what he had deſigned to execute, but never could do it; which was, to take <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due proud <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo acknowledg, there was never found in any <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince, the admirable Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Henry;</hi> ſhewing himſelf herein greater, than in vanquiſhing his Enemies. Contrary to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> who ſhewed only great Kindneſs to an <hi>Ox,</hi> whom he cauſed to be carefully fed, becauſe he would never forſake the Tomb of his Maſter, whom this Prince had killed; abiding always by it, and expreſſing his Sorrow by horrible Bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In all other Occaſions, he was very cruel; far from the Humor of this <hi>French</hi> King, who heapt Benefits on thoſe, who drew Blood of him. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by a barbarous Cruelty, cauſed the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Twenty of his innocent Pages to be ript open, to diſcover him that had eaten a Melon in his Garden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> was a great Lover of Ladies, and an extream Admirer of that Sex; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the too great Beauty of his Miſtriſs, cut off her Head himſelf in a full <hi>Divan.</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if <hi>Mahomet</hi> gave in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Juſtice, in putting his own Son to Death, for deflowring the Daughter of the <hi>Baſſa Achmet</hi> in a Bath; <hi>Henry</hi> gave a greater in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in repairing at the Head of his Army, the Outrage offered to a young Girl, from whom he could not fear any vexatious Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Be ſure, however, be ſilent in theſe Judgments I make; and, ſhew thy ſelf diſcreet, if thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to hold any Correſpondence with me.</p>
                  <p>Imitate the Bees; gather from ſo many Flowers preſented thee, what appears to thee ſweeteſt, and moſt proper to form <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Mind, and ſupple his Spirit like Wax.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:46436:101"/>
                  <p>I could relate to thee more Things touching this <hi>Henry;</hi> but there's no Neceſſity of writing all; that thou maiſt have ſpace to imagine, what ſuch a Prince might have done, who had re-eſtabliſhed his Fortune by his Valour alone.</p>
                  <p>Let me know of thy Departure; and when thou ſhalt arrive at the Place of thy Retreat, forget not thy faithful Friend <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who wiſhes thou maiſt prove an happpy Tutor to the Son of a Prince, and a faithful Miniſter of a wiſe Emperor.</p>

                  <p>'Tis ſaid, That being ſenſible he was near his End, he cauſed two young <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Slaves to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, who were nobly deſcended, and for whoſe Ranſom great Sums of Money might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, without alledging any reaſon for his Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nay, after he had confeſſed he had no cauſe of Complaint againſt them, having obſerv'd from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Tokens in their Countenances, that they were of a ſweet Diſpoſition, and inclined by Nature to be Faithful. When he was laying out, there was found a kind of fine Scarf about him, with theſe Words embroidered on it in Letters of Gold; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam Baſſa <hi>will have the handſomeſt of his Slaves to be buried alive with him, being deſirous of good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in his Voyage into the other World.</hi>

                  <head>To the Invincible <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> at the Camp under <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BEfore I give thee an Account, Great and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous <hi>Vizir,</hi> of whatever I have done to ſatisfie the Curioſity of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to tell thee how I ſpend my leiſure Hours.</p>
                  <p>'Tis impoſſible I ſhould obſerve exactly the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Court, without following it, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Correſpondence with People of all ſorts, as Tradeſmen, Soldiers, Scholars, Sea-men, Politicians, and even Muſicians.</p>
                  <p>The Court conſiſts of all theſe Profeſſions, and there are ſome particular Perſons who are Maſters of all theſe Sciences, of which number is Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> He is not content with this his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ſeeks ſtill for further Light in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of all Perſons of Merit, who arrive here; neglecting nothing which may enrich this Kingdom with new diſcoveries in Arts and Sciences, out of love to his Country, and deſire to render his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry more famous.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt by this, Invincible <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that to keep company with Courtiers, who have ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Qualities, a Man muſt have ſome for his ſhare, that he may ſay ſomething in his Turn, and not be always a bare Hearer of other People's Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, the particular Study to which I applied my ſelf, whilſt I was a Slave in <hi>Sicily,</hi> does much help me, though not ſufficiently. 'Twas Books I read in this Iſland, not Men. Now, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Buſineſs required much Diſſimulation, an Awakened Mind, an Eſpecial Prudence, Eloquence and Learning to ſpeak properly in Occaſions, great
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46436:103"/>Reading to obtain the Knowledge of Ancient and Modern Things, a Refined Policy to diſcover or conceal ones ſelf, and to counterfeit ſometimes a mighty honeſt Man; nothing, I ſay, appeared to me more conducing to this purpoſe, than the turning over Hiſtories. And therefore I have earneſtly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to this Work. And, becauſe few Books are not ſufficient, and a great many breeds confuſion, I have happily got Admiſſion into the Acquaintance of an Ancient Learned Man, whoſe Study conſiſts of none but choice Books, and has travelled over moſt Parts of the World, not like <hi>Apollonius,</hi> to learn the Language of Birds and Beaſts, but to know the Cuſtoms, Laws, Virtues and Defects of Nations. I was firſt for informing my ſelf of all the Prodigies, which the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> has done, in favour of that ungrateful People. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enquired into the Life and Doctrin of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Worſhip. I alſo lookt into what had been done conſiderable at <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta, Thebes, Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and carefully remarkt what Divinities were adored in thoſe ſo famous Places, and found that the Great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Captains, who made ſuch a Noiſe about their Religions, had at Bottom none at all. Having run over what the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the Hiſtories of <hi>Joſephus, Xenophon, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius, Thucydides, Livius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus;</hi> my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Application has been, and ſhall be for the future, to read and meditate on the Works of the Great <hi>Plutarch,</hi> eſpecially his Lives of Illuſtrious <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> related by him with ſo great Exactneſs. And thus far have I arrived in this ſhort ſpace, and here I have ſtopt. I have learnt by the reading of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to amuſe the Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to whom I offered my ſelf two days ago; and have put into his Hands the following Diſcourſe made after the manner of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:46436:103"/>and have ſtript my ſelf, if a man may ſo ſpeak, of the Manner and Style of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as I have done of their Habits, the better to diſguiſe <hi>Titus,</hi> the Faithful Slave of the Great <hi>Amurath.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia</hi> is come to wait on you according to your Commands, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you with the Riches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> nor in what manner by the Wiſdom of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and Forces of the King your Soveraign, you may deſtroy the mighty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, of whom you have no reaſon to complain; but to tell you, what ſeems moſt agreeable to the Greatneſs of your <hi>Genius.</hi> Know then, Sage Moderator of the <hi>French</hi> Monarch, that I ſhall not offer any thing which may make you hate me, and repent of believing me, ſeeing, what I propoſe, is an eaſie En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and full of Glory. Thy King has a Son, who will one day inherit the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Authority of his Father; you know not the Temper and Diſpoſitions which this Heir may have, being as yet ſo much a Child, that a man cannot gather any thing certain of this matter. But, a Prince that has been ſo long lookt for, requires extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Deſigns to be laid for him, and great Preparations made betimes, to raiſe a Palace that may be worthy to entertain him.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46436:104"/>I would propoſe to you a Palace, I ſay, of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Architecture, the like was never ſeen or imagined, and which you may with your own hands rear up in <hi>Paris,</hi> which muſt be of a ſquare Form, whoſe Corners ſhall regard <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and whoſe Richneſs ſhall draw all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it. You will not need Stone, Sand, Wood nor Iron for this Work. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects which you ſhall employ, ſhall have the Secret, with their Pen, Ink, and Paper to raiſe this Edifice, which ſhall be of a more laſting Durance than the <hi>Pancteon</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> and whereon, as on the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there ſhould be no noiſe of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
                              <p>Think not, Wiſe Miniſter, they are <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's</hi> which <hi>Titus</hi> has in his Head. Hear then the Deſign of this Majeſtical Palace, whoſe Foundations are already laid by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> with Materials more precious than Gold or Rubies. Thou knoweſt the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this Philoſopher had, of rendring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal the Actions of ſo many Great Men, of whom perhaps there might have been no Mention, had <hi>Plutarch</hi> lay ſilent. Men now read in the moſt remote Provinces of the <hi>Indies,</hi> written on Leaves and Barks of Trees, the Lives of <hi>Alexander, Caeſar, Scipio, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes.</hi> Amongſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46436:104"/>the <hi>Solitary</hi>'s of the moſt Deſart Parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Derviſes,</hi> who dwell at <hi>Medina,</hi> are found written in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Characters, the Hiſtories of <hi>Numa, Ariſtides, Cato, Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have rendred this Author ſo famous in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> that theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> not contented with having tranſlated into their Languages, all the Lives of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> they have ordered (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) that every Five Years new Copies be made, to the end they may be eternally preſerved. I have ſeen my ſelf at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> above an hundred Volumes in Silken Paper, wherein the Works of this Famous <hi>Greek</hi> are read with Veneration by the greateſt <hi>Captains, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Divines;</hi> and theſe Works are enriched with moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Notes in <hi>Arabick,</hi> in <hi>Perſian,</hi> and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, by the expreſs Orders of the <hi>Sultans,</hi> who make them be preſerved as Illuſtrious Monuments of the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Eloquence. You are not ignorant of the Eſteem which <hi>Solyman the Great</hi> had of <hi>Pompey, Caeſar, Pyrrhus,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and that he never undertook any Military Enterprize, till he had conſulted theſe great Maſters in the Art of War; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wont to ſay, he knew not whether <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
                                 <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46436:105"/>or <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> had ſhewed more Valour in Engagements, than <hi>Plutarch</hi> had ſhewed Wit and Judgment in deſcribing them. But in a Voyage I made into <hi>Germany,</hi> what did not an old <hi>Rabin</hi> tell me, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the Lives of Illuſtrious Men of this Incomparable Author tranſlated into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, which he carried ever about with him? he aſſured me that the Curious of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſet ſuch a value on them, that there are above Ten Thouſand Manuſcript Copies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the Synagogues, both in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts.</p>
                              <p>Men, Women and Children know of what Account this Famous Author is, in all our <hi>Europe.</hi> He now ſpeaks all Languages: The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Polanders</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> have naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him among them. And you know very well, Sir, that in this Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> the Learned not content with having him Tranſlated into their Idiom, they carefully adorn their Libraries with this Author in his own natural Tongue, and have Collected the <hi>Latin, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Verſions of him.</p>
                              <p>But 'tis now Sixteen Hundred Years ſince <hi>Plutarch</hi> keeps ſilence; ſo many Men Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their Knowledge, and ſo many great Captains who have lived ſince, are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46436:105"/>unknown to the World, becauſe they have met with no <hi>Plutarch</hi> to know them. And this is the ſtately Building which I offer you to finiſh, who are ſo great a Lover of Glory; for God has given you a Mind with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Power to finiſh what <hi>Plutarch</hi> has ſo profitably begun. Raiſe up immediately by your Authority, on the precious Foundation, which this Incomparable Philoſopher has laid, the Walls and Roof of this vaſt Building. Order Lodgings to be made ready for all the <hi>Hero</hi>'s, who could not enter into this firſt Edifice; I mean, thoſe Illuſtrious Dead, whoſe Lives have not been carefully Collected, and who ſhould honour <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> where they were born, and the New World will yield you wherewith to fill this Palace with <hi>Atabalippa</hi>'s and <hi>Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s.</p>
                              <p>Hereby wilt thou be the Reſtorer of thoſe Ruins, which Time has made; and in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Statues of ſo many Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Civil Adminiſtrations, in War and in good Letters, you will raiſe up an infinite Number throughout the World, as the firſt Emperor of the <hi>Romans</hi> did. 'Tis to no purpoſe to ſay, there are a great many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that have written, ſince <hi>Plutarch,</hi> the Actions of ſeveral Great Commanders, Kings and Great Miniſters, whoſe Vertues were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46436:106"/>eminently conſpicuous, both in Peace and War. I hope I ſhall not give juſt offence in ſaying, That few of theſe Writers have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s excellent Method; for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they appear obſcure by reaſon of their great Conciſeneſs, or the Facts are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded in General Hiſtories, or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by intereſſed or paſſionate Pens, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the Truth, and impoſe Fabulous Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the World. For a Proof of this, be pleaſed to examin particular Events, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Lives of <hi>Francis I.</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and of the Emperor <hi>Charles V.</hi> and you will find there are thoſe who aſſure us, that <hi>Charles</hi> dyed a Saint, and that ſcarcely was he expired, when <hi>Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-Luces were ſeen to ſpring up in his Chamber, which yielded a moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Scent:</hi> Whilſt others affirm, that this Hero dyed an Heretick, by the Aſſiſtance of his Confeſſor, who had embraced the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Doctrin. And, how many Romances are made of <hi>Francis I?</hi> Has it not been ſaid, That he fought a Duel with this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and that this Prince paſſing through <hi>France,</hi> the King by a Motive of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (beyond any Precedent) offered him his Kingdom? That <hi>Charles</hi> had one day ſat on <hi>Francis</hi>'s Throne, and condemned a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, and afterwards reprieved him, as a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46436:106"/>Mark of his Authority? And has it not been moreover ſaid, That <hi>Francis</hi> took <hi>Charles</hi> in a Battel? How many falſe Relations have been made of <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa,</hi> Two famous Sea-Captains, the one a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the other a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi> and both of them Chief Admirals of Two mighty Emperors, <hi>Charles V.</hi> and <hi>Solyman?</hi> Has it not been confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> being in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago,</hi> gave a Viſit in the Diſguiſe of a <hi>Monk</hi> to <hi>Doria?</hi> That in an Iſland where this Interview was made, they had ſworn, one on the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the other on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to help one another to conſerve their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which their Employs gave them at Sea; and, to make themſelves more neceſſary to their Soveraigns, they were always to avoid a deciſive Combat, that they might not ruin one another? That they had moreover both ſigned this Treaty with their own Blood? Has there not been added to this Fable, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Admiral ſent to <hi>Doria</hi> a <hi>Moor;</hi> who pretended to be a Fugitive from the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Army, and wore two Pearls of an ineſtimable Price in his Ears; and, that in Exchange, <hi>Doria</hi> had aſſured <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> not to interrupt him, whenever he pleaſed to invade any of the Coaſts of <hi>Italy?</hi>

                                 <hi>Here's the Reſt of the Lives of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Men, from the Emperor <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> to <hi>Lewis the Juſt;</hi> of thoſe that have excelled in Arms, Learning, Affairs of State, and of thoſe who have held the firſt Rank in the Church in all Parts of the World; and theſe Hiſtories have been Collected by a Colledge of the Learnedeſt Men in <hi>Europe,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Spaniards, French, Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> under the Auſpicious Conduct of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>

                              <p>I would have three Perſons of each Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attend this Work, and who ſhould make their Abode in <hi>Paris,</hi> as being the principal City in <hi>France.</hi> And, I propoſe <hi>Spaniards, Italians, Germans</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as the moſt poliſhed Nations, and who have furniſhed the World with the moſt able Men. Now, every Nation having its particular Way of Speaking and Acting, the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice will be the more agreeable, and each Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect will have greater Room to ſhew his Skill. Thoſe who ſhall read theſe Works, will find in the Softneſs of the <hi>French</hi> Style
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46436:107"/>wherewithal to mollifie the too ſevere Gravity of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Eloquence. The Sincerity of the <hi>Germans</hi> ever attended with ſome kind of Dryneſs, will appear without Rudeneſs with the Flowers and good Senſe of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Writers. And, as all the World will be intereſſed in this magnificent Deſign, ſo we muſt not doubt but the wiſeſt of all theſe States will take care in the choice of the Subjects which they will propoſe. And, in fine, if thou wilt have the chief Men in the World, thou needeſt not want the ſecret of raiſing up <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s. Be not weary of giving Marks of thy Liberality; for, if thou wilt have <hi>Titus Livy's,</hi> become <hi>Maecenas.</hi>

                              <p>It doth not belong to me, to ſay in what manner 'tis neceſſary in this occaſion, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them of ſeveral Nations, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute theſe Employs: Thou art equitable and prudent, ſo that this Work being begun, the End will have a Succeſs anſwerable to its Beginning. I ſhall only put thee in Mind, that thou wilt not a little contribute to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Immortality more Glorious; if thou remembreſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> thy ſworn Enemies, being perſwaded thou mayſt find amongſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors, <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Vizirs</hi> wherewithal to enrich the New <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Let not the Greatneſs of the Work diſcourage thee; how great ſoever it be, thy Wit and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46436:108"/>are above it, and thou wilt not want An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Authors to aſſiſt thee. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> will furniſh thee with the Lives of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> which may be left entire as they are. <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> gives as good an account of many of the Philoſophers. You'll receive Advantage from the Works of <hi>Aemilius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Paul Jovius,</hi> and ſeveral others, who have acquired Immortal Reputation by the Books which they have given the Publick. You will find a Draught already made of the Hiſtory of Two Hundred and Twenty Eight Emperors, from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand III.</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim I.</hi> the one Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the other of <hi>Turky;</hi> which thou ſhalt cauſe to be carefully examin'd by the Colledge, to clear up ſuch things as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, adding what is wanting, and retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Events of which there is no ſufficient proof, and which ſeem fabulous; and, in a Word, for drawing up particular Lives which are to be met with in general Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which have been the Method of moſt Writers of late Ages.</p>
                              <p>I would have alſo <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, of comparing the Illuſtrious Men of one Nation with thoſe of another; where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>Writer</hi> having weighed the Reaſons which make for the one and the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a Sentence which does both delight and inſtruct the Reader.</p>
                              <pb n="207" facs="tcp:46436:108"/>
                              <p>The moſt important Inſtruction then which can be given, being the Secret of knowing Men perfectly, who ſeek with ſo great Care to hide themſelves; the true means for this, is the choice of Matter, that the Reader may not loſe his Time, ſtudy in vain, but gather the Fruit which all Men of Senſe ſearch for, which is, to know what is Good, that they may follow it, and Evil to avoid it. On this ground you will be eaſily perſwaded, there's greater Pleaſure to behold the Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who paſſes with one only Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to find out <hi>Sifax,</hi> than there is in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him, when he gives Battle to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Rama.</hi> We are more edifi'd in ſeeing this young General a Conqueror, and yet ſo continent, as to ſend the fineſt Woman in the World, who was his Priſoner, to <hi>Lucius</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince her Husband, without touching her; than in the Relation of an hundred Sieges of Places, where, the Effects which the Soldiers Fury produces, Hunger and Thirſt, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of human Blood, yields Horror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Diverſion. In like manner, Sir, you will acknowledge, That a Prince or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will be more inſtructed by ſeeing <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> who lived like a King, though in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who careſſes and recompenſes Learned Men all the World over; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46436:109"/>in ſeeing <hi>Fabricius,</hi> who refuſes and deſpiſes the greateſt Honours which are offered him with immenſe Riches, and who ſnatches away the Poyſon from the Mouth of the greateſt Enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> People; than all the Combats and moſt bloody Battles fought by <hi>Pyrrhus, Charles V.</hi> and the great <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I have made you this long Diſcourſe, as a Mark of my Obedience; and <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia</hi> at the Feet of your Eminency, ſupplicates you to conſider, That when by your Negotiations, Councils and Armies which receive your Orders, you ſhall have added new Kingdoms to that which your Maſter holds; when for the benefit of Trade and Navigation, you ſhall have joyned all the Seas together; and when, in a Word, you ſhall raiſe Bridges in <hi>Paris,</hi> Pyramids with more Palaces than were built by the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and all the Kings of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Theſe Pyles will not be Immortal, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Injuries of Time; whereas, on the contrary, if you ſend for the Twelve Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects which I mentioned to raiſe the ſtately Palace afore-cited, all the World will bleſs the Name of <hi>Armand</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu,</hi> Reſtorer of the Republick of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning almoſt ruined; and who, like another <hi>Archimedes,</hi> hath known by the Examples

                  <p>THe King, ſome days paſt, was preſent at a Ball, where there was a great number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality of both Sexes.

                  </head>
                  <p>THou haſt gotten up from a great Sickneſs, and I expect one. I have had, for ſome Days, a Faintneſs, which does extreamly depreſs me, but by the Grace of God, I need not yet the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. The Letter which I received from thee this Moon, has given me ſome eaſe in my Indiſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is no new Thing with me, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to live ſo far from my Friends, Country, yea, and Religion too. And though it may ſeem difficult to be a Saint, in paſſing ones days in a Prophane Place, yet think not my Piety grows luke-warm, or my Friendſhip diminiſhed; ſeeing I have made a <hi>Moſque</hi> of my Heart, where Friends are ever preſent. Be then perſwaded, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Mahmut</hi> to become unfaithful, and loſe the Affection he has for his Friends; for he never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46436:111"/>to love, where he has once begun. 'Tis true indeed, that I call my ſelf <hi>Titus</hi> at preſent, and am cloathed in an odd ſort of Dreſs; yet that is no Hindrance of my Affections to my Religion, my Country, and my Friends.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> have written a great deal about Friendſhip, and the Duties of a Friend; but there remains ſtill behind, more than what they have ſaid, as there remains more to do than they have done. The Word <hi>Friend</hi> is a common Name, and appropriated by moſt People; but where wilt thou find a Man that gives Proofs of a true and unfeigned Friendſhip? I think I am no Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; be thou as true to me at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and inform me what paſſes in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and how it goes with our Friends and Relations in all Parts.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give thee no Account of the Tranſactions of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> amongſt which I live, being tired with writing them to the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> and the <hi>Kai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macan.</hi> Imitate me not herein, for thou aboundeſt with Leaſure; let me then hear from thee every Moon.</p>
                  <p>I have had ſeveral Fits of Laughter, at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Adventure of the Chamber-Maid to the old Slave, with the Eunuch <hi>Melec-Aubi.</hi> Bleſſings on the Heart of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I believe the <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> will laugh himſelf in his <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> when the Angel his Meſſenger, who brings him News from this World, ſhall give him an Account of what theſe two Perſons have ridiculouſly done in Honour of him. Could there ever be a greater Simplicity, than to eat every Night a Verſicle of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> written on a piece of <hi>China</hi> Sattin? Whence did this Eunuch, thy Camrade, learn this ſtrange Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition? and by what Spirit did he authoriſe that of this Slave, in taking the Pains to write theſe Verſicles with his own Hand? And when could they imagine both of them, they ſhould make
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46436:111"/>an end of this Feaſt, ſeeing the whole <hi>Alcoran</hi> could not be eaten in leſs than Six Thouſand Forty three Days, the Book containing ſo many Verſicles? Pray let me know what is done to them. They deſerve not, in my poor Judgement, an over rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Puniſhment, their Crime being only a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Devotion. The Great and Venerable <hi>Mufti</hi> will ſoon decide the Buſineſs; yet I would fain know the Manner.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now impart to thee an Account of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit which I gave a <hi>Solitary</hi> in my Travels into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who ſpent his Days far from the Commerce of the World, in a little Hermitage, about fifteen Miles diſtance from <hi>Vienna.</hi> This man, who is now very Old, has paſt forty Years of his Life in great Auſterity, doing every thing our Famous <hi>Santons</hi> are celebrated for; and thou ſhalt know what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to this ſevere Penance, and to retire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. 'Tis ſaid, That in his Youth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been threatned for ſome Miſdemeanour with Impriſonment, he hid himſelf in the Houſe of a Faithful Friend, lying in a Barrel covered over with Straw, where was brought him privately his Diet. Whilſt he thus lay concealed in the Veſſel, a certain Perſon went up into the Garret, his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with his Hoſts Siſter; when theſe two Perſons thinking themſelves alone, came to ſuch Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as much ſcandaliz'd this new <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who ſaw all that paſt, through the Crevices of this Tub; and being not able to contain his Reſentments, he thus paſſionately brake out, <hi>God ſees you, you Wretches, and Man too.</hi> In a Word, his Indignation was ſo great, that the Tub or Barrel was overthrown; with the Noiſe of which, and his ſcrambling up, the Two Lovers were ſo afrighted, that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant for haſte broke his Neck down Stairs, and the Nymph lay dead in a Swoon on the place. This ſtrange Surprize to all, eſpecially the Sight of ſo
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46436:112"/>Filthy and Tragical a Spectacle, ſo affected this young Man, as made him retire from the World into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, where he now remains. He lives only on Bread and Water; and the Averſion which he has conceived on this occaſion, to Women, is ſo great, that there is none dares appear before him. There were two who had the Curioſity of ſeeing this <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> in Mens Cloaths, but they ſoon repented of their Viſit; for this <hi>Solitary</hi> full of Rage and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, thus welcomed them; <hi>Get you gone, you</hi> Daemons, <hi>fallen from Heaven for Mens Deſtruction; I know very well what you are, and cannot behold you without Horrour.</hi> He makes excellent Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to young Men who viſit him, and having ſhewed them the Care they ought to take to live with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and rule their Paſſions, to which corrupt Nature renders them ſubject; he alſo exhorts them to hold a Glaſs before their Faces when ſeized with Anger, or when carried forth to the Commiſſion of any Brutiſh or unſeemly Action.</p>
                  <p>My Letter is longer than I intended; receive, as a Mark of my Friendſhip, the long time I have entertained my ſelf with thee, when I thought at firſt to ſpeak all in two Words. Give this Letter, directed to thee, into <hi>Zelim</hi>'s own Hands; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains things which concern his Life. As to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, Love ever thy Faithful <hi>Mahmut,</hi> whilſt I ſhall pray the Sovereign of the greateſt Monarchs, as well as other Men, that he would, after this Life give us Eternal Felicity, and the Grace to appear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent before his dreadful Tribunal, at which all Men ſhall be Judged.</p>

There is no neceſſity of my ſending the Picture of a Man, who ſets forth from <hi>Leghorn</hi> for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with a deſign to kill thee. Thou mayſt eaſily know him, ſeeing he has been Six Years a Slave in thy Gally. <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> ſent me this Advice from <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſo important for thy Life; adding, he ſet out with his Brother, being reſolved to periſh, or be revenged of a great Injury which thou haſt done him.</p>
                  <p>He has fill'd <hi>Italy</hi> with Diſcourſes of thy Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He affirms, That having tryed all Ways to make him a <hi>Turk,</hi> ſeeing neither Preſents not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes could perſwade him, thou haſt made him ſuffer the moſt cruel Torments a Man can undergo; and, that being laid faſt aſleep, by a Potion which thou cauſedſt him to take, thou haſt made him be caſtrated. The Weapons he bears to rid himſelf of thee, will ſtrike thee without Noiſe, ſo that thou needeſt be much on thy Guard. He hides that which is to do the Buſineſs, in a little Prayer-Book. Revenge, which does uſually make Men induſtrious, has put him upon concealing in this Manual, a little poyſoned Steel Dart, which is incloſed with ſuch great Art in the Leather that covers it, that 'tis ſhot thence as from a Bow, and ſtrikes with ſuch Violence and Swiftneſs, that the Stroak can't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, nor ſcarcely felt by him that receives it,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46436:113"/>it cauſing not one drop of Blood to follow, nor Wound to be ſeen; ſo delicately tempered is the Mortal Weapon, that the Man muſt unavoidably dye, whom it hits.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt, but this revengeful Spirit, will cunningly conceal himſelf, ſo that 'twill be hard to diſcover him. But having had this Advice, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thee to take care of thy ſelf. And in the mean time, correct this cruel and ſevere Temper of thine. Thou commandeſt a Gally mann'd with Slaves, who live at thy Charge; thou reckoneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thy Riches Three Hundred <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who dreſs thy Gardens, and ſerve thee at Sea; and thou haſt never remembred, they are Men which may ſave, or take away thy Life; and that ranging the Seas as thou doſt, 'tis poſſible thou mayſt meet with the ſame Fortune, and be made a Slave thy ſelf. Thou haſt never conſider'd, that Death is more ſupportable than Slavery, and that thoſe that deſpiſe their own Lives, are Maſters of thine. God preſerve thee, and incline thine Heart to uſe gently thy Slaves, who are ſo uſeful to thee. Follow my Advice; thou haſt Three Hundred Enemies in thine Houſe, do what in thee lies to gain their Love. Learn this of a Famous <hi>Roman,</hi> who made his Slaves born in his Houſe, to be nurſt with the ſame Milk his Children were. If thou art not for ſuch an Indulgence, at leaſt ceaſe to be Cruel, otherwiſe thou wilt be more a Slave than thoſe that ſerve thee. If thou wilt not ſpare theſe People in Love to them, pity their Condition, and ſpare them in Love to thy ſelf; whereby thou wilt live in ſo great Tranquility, as cannot be imagined. The <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> guard thee from the Danger threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee, and deſtroy this raſh <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who would aſſaſſinate thee.</p>

                  <head>To the Invincible <hi>Vizir Azim,</hi> at the Camp before <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere are various Diſcourſes here of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s War-like Preparations. And 'tis common for People to confound here, the Antient <hi>Babylon,</hi> with <hi>Suſa</hi> and <hi>Bagdet;</hi> but this is no great matter. 'Tis certain, all the <hi>Infidels</hi> Wiſhes are in thy Favour; for they deſire to ſee thee Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, not only of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but all the Eaſt; that <hi>Amurath</hi> may be the longer in his Return to <hi>Greece,</hi> and chooſe a place far diſtant from the Seat of his Empire. 'Tis diſcourſed in this Court, as if the Invincible <hi>Sultan</hi> carries along with him to this War, Four Hundred Thouſand Foot, an Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Horſe, and Two Hundred <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, and moreover Twelve Princes Tributary to the <hi>Port.</hi> 'Tis alſo ſaid, <hi>Bagdet</hi> is a Place not to be won by Force; that a River, the ſwifteſt in the World, runs through the midſt of it; and, that the place has an Hundred Gates of Braſs, and its Walls, which are very high, be defended by three Hundred Pieces of Cannon; That the <hi>Perſian</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are great enough to tire out the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and that the example of <hi>Cha Abbas,</hi> Father to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> who now reigns over the <hi>Perſians,</hi> will encreaſe their Valour and Obſtinacy, to ſuffer the greateſt Extremities, rather than to think of a Surrender. The raſh Reſolution of this King <hi>Abbas,</hi> in the laſt Siege of this Great City, is ſo cryed up, and magnifyed here, that ſcarce is there any Room left for the Praiſes of <hi>Amurath.</hi> This Prince's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and repaſſing more than once, in a Bark, in the Sight of Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46436:114"/>in Perſon, the beſieged of the condition of Affairs, and to give them a freſh Courage, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them they ſhould be ſoon ſuccour'd, and having at the ſame time about him wherewith to hinder him from falling alive or dead into the Hands of his Enemies; was an Action which they think is above all <hi>Elogium</hi>'s, and appears to them greater than Story could ever parallel. 'Tis ſaid, That this King carryed in his Bark two great Stones faſtned to one and the ſame Cord, to put them on his Neck to ſink himſelf into the River, which was of an unfathomable Depth, in caſe he was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. To which they add, That <hi>Amurath,</hi> who can never have his Fill of Bloud, will recompenſe thy Services in the ſame manner he did thy Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> hold moreover other Diſcourſes, which are very impertinent, confounding ſuch things as are true, with falſe; as they do the Juſtice and Liberality of the Generous and ever Invincible <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> with the Cruelty and Avarice wherewith they reproach him. 'Tis ſaid likewiſe, That the Sequins which he diſtributed the Day whereon he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Emperour, were not by one half of the value which was ſet upon them; That he cauſed <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Caire</hi> to be ſtrangled, for no other Reaſon but to become Maſter of his Wealth. 'Tis further added, That this Prince having had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that a Gally was taken, having Seventy Five conſiderable. Officers belonging to the <hi>Port</hi> on Board, whilſt he was diverting himſelf in a Pleaſure-Houſe at the Entrance into <hi>Aſia;</hi> he ſaid by way of Jeſt, <hi>Let's drink the Health of theſe Stout Blades.</hi> 'Tis moreover ſaid, That having given his Word, and promiſed a ſecure Paſſage to the brave <hi>Facardin,</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince, he cauſed him to be ſtabb'd in a thouſand places in his Sight. But what do not they ſay of his deſtroying the <hi>Mufti,</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46436:114"/>
                     <hi>Greek</hi> Patriarch? In fine, they ſet forth <hi>Amurath</hi> as a Sacrilegious Wretch, that deſpiſes his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, an Heretick and Enemy to our <hi>Holy Prophet.</hi> They relate the particulars of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Death, which makes me doubt there be Traitors at the <hi>Port,</hi> who advertiſe the <hi>Infidels</hi> of the moſt ſecret Matters which paſs there. Some ſay, his <hi>Eloquence</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him ſuſpected to <hi>Amurath,</hi> and that he ſaid theſe Words when he was led to the Caſtle of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Towers, <hi>Could I ſpeak but once to our great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he will be forced to love me, or repent.</hi> And 'tis ſaid, That having voyaged into <hi>England,</hi> he had learnt Magick there. Many People believed he would introduce Novelties in Religion, and for this End held ſtrict Correſpondences with the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed <hi>Monks;</hi> and 'tis known here, that when his Sentence was pronounced, he ſaid, <hi>He would riſe again to torment the Emperour, and perplex his Affairs.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> haivng blamed what I now mentioned, do extreamly praiſe the Moderation of <hi>Amurath,</hi> when he took the <hi>Perſian</hi> Spy, who ſlid into his Camp in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit, and crouded amongſt the <hi>True Faithful;</hi> for he careſſed him, and ſent him back with Rich Preſents. They alſo admire the Patience of this Prince, in only condemning to the Gallies the Thirty <hi>Indian</hi> Pilgrims, who occaſioned his Fall from his Horſe in the Capital City of his Kingdom: For the Horſe was affrighted at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel of theſe Men, and the ſtrange Figure they made, when they threw themſelves on the Ground to beg Mony of him; but they at the ſame time charge this Emperour with Brutiſhneſs, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with his own hand immediately the Horſe that threw him down. The Diſcourſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, however injurious they are, be not of great Importance. But if I be not miſtaken, there is ſomething carrying on againſt us with the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Venice.</hi> I obſerve, its Embaſſadour ſince
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46436:115"/>the Loſs we have made of Fifteen Gallies at <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> has frequent and ſecret Conferences with the King and Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu.</hi> As 'tis not doubted but that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire will be reveng'd of ſo deep an Injury, ſo 'tis alſo judged, that the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> will uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to unite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Confederacy the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, and 'tis to be feared leſt they take the Time, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is employed in the Seige of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to form ſome Enterprize, or put themſelves into a Condition wherein they cannot be attacked. I ſhall carefully obſerve all the Motions of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and if need requires, diſpatch an expreſs Meſſenger to the <hi>Kaimakan.</hi> I adore thy Grandure, buryed in the Duſt of thy Feet.</p>

                  <p>THe Courier not parting till the Morrow, I make uſe of this ſhort Time to write again to thee. <hi>Brizac,</hi> as I have already given Advice, was taken by the Forces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Swedeland;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wimar,</hi> who commands the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, brags, that being become Maſter of this Place, which has always been beſieged in Vain, he ſhall take ſeveral others, there being none which hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward can reſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Bannier,</hi> one of the Generals of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armies, wearied out the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in <hi>Pomerania</hi> with continual Alarms. He took <hi>Gratz,</hi> a conſiderable place, and has beaten <hi>Galas,</hi> one of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46436:115"/>Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi>'s Generals. But Fortune ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chang'd her Countenance, has favoured the Emperour againſt the Troops of the <hi>Palatin,</hi> who is taken Priſoner with Prince <hi>Robert</hi> his Brother, having been like to be drowned in the River of <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> whereinto he was drawn in his Coach by his Horſes, who took Fright at the noiſe of the Cannon: And theſe unfortunate Princes, have loſt in this occaſion, with their Liberty, whatever was moſt precious to them. The <hi>Swedes</hi> have in the mean time encreaſed their Strength, by the Conjunction of new Troops. They make frequent Incurſions on the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and 'tis thought this War will laſt a conſiderable Time, by the great Preparations which are made on all Hands, and eſpecially by the <hi>French,</hi> to whom it ſeems important that it ſhould not end ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>There is News from <hi>Italy,</hi> That a Diſcovery has been made in <hi>Piemont,</hi> of new Cabals of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who deſigned to put by the Dutcheſs from her Regency, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſter of the Government, during the Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the young Duke. There is a Cardinal of this Name, an ambitious Man, a great Lover of War, and given to Liberality. He would fain have the chief Share in the Government, and be the Maſter of his Nephews Fortune. This Cardinal lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> being cloathed in an Habit little becoming his Character, and whence he ſent his Orders, for the Execution of whatever he had concerted with his Partiſans; but the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy got Wind, and proved a Bloody Tragedy to his Accomplices. 'Tis ſaid, that this Prince having twice diſguiſed himſelf in the Habit of a Peaſant, had entred with a Bag of Fruit on his Back, into one of the moſt conſiderable Towns of <hi>Piemont,</hi> to give by his Preſence more Heat to his Party; and that with a greater Boldneſs he had entred into
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46436:116"/>
                     <hi>Turin,</hi> in the Habit of a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> with a long thick Beard, and abode there two Days; not in deſign of ridding himſelf of the Prince, or his Mother, but to become Maſter both of one and the other, to govern the State alone. But the Conſpiracy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been diſcovered, and the Accomplices ſeized; Fourſcore of them were put to Death by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hangman, and he eſcaped by a new Stratagem. A Secretary of State of <hi>Savoy</hi> is to be reckoned amongſt this Number. Another Cardinal, who commands the Army of <hi>France,</hi> ſent to the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Duke and Dutcheſs, had alſo put to Death the Governour of <hi>Cazal,</hi> accuſed of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though he was not fully convicted of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Written from <hi>Rome,</hi> That two Embaſſadours from the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who is lately Elected Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> had made a magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that great City, clad after the <hi>Hungarian</hi> manner with Veſts, called here <hi>a la barbareſque;</hi> That, they had above an Hundred Horſe, whoſe Harneſs were of Gold, and their Shoes of Silver, and 'twas eſpecially obſerved, that all the Foreign Miniſters in that Court, had ſent their Retinue to accompany them in their Entrance, that it might appear more Magnificent; and, that theſe two Embaſſadours of the new Emperour, being arrived in the Preſence of the <hi>Infidel</hi>'s <hi>Mufti,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Pope,</hi> they told him, their Prince would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to render him the Obedience which his Father <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> now deceaſed, paid him, and that he recommended to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> his Perſon, his Houſe, and his State, as a new Emperour, elected by the Suffrages of the Princes Electors of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, Magnanimous <hi>Vizir,</hi> the Authority of this <hi>Mufti:</hi> thoſe who are ſo audacious, as to reſiſt the <hi>Muſſulmen,</hi> will yet abaſe themſelves at <hi>his</hi> Feet, which they really kiſs before they open their Mouths to ſpeak to him. The greateſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:46436:116"/>Princes are wont to chooſe from amongſt the moſt conſiderable Perſons of their State, the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors which they ſend with great Expence, to pay their Homage to this Supream <hi>Head</hi> of their Church. Moreover, theſe Embaſſadors of the New <hi>Caeſar,</hi> have aſſured the <hi>Pope,</hi> as from him, that he will never ceaſe to make War with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith; and 'tis ſaid, they received this Anſwer:</p>
                  <p>That, <hi>he ever reſpected the King of</hi> Hungary, <hi>the late Elected Emperor, as his Son, to whom he would never be wanting in Concil, and all other neceſſary Aſſiſtances;</hi> and exhorted him, <hi>to employ his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arms againſt the Enemies of the Croſs;</hi> and that; <hi>on his ſide, he would employ the Succors of his Prayers, that the</hi> Church <hi>ſhould open her Treaſures by granting Indulgences;</hi> and that, <hi>he would beſides this, give Supplies of Men and Mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>People who are idle, amuſe themſelves with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on future Events, and thoſe that conſult the Stars to penetrate into what is to come, have made a Marriage between the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> a Prince born ſome Months ſince, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> lately come into the World. 'Tis true, that at the moment this Princeſs ſaw the Light, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Grandees of the Kingdom, tryed who ſhould out-do one another in Feaſtings, to ſolemnize this Birth: And the like was done in <hi>France,</hi> for that of the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> both being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with extraordiary Magnificence, and prodigious Liberalities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catholick</hi> King has given the Quality of Grandee to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who was Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and has declared him <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo</hi> of the Four Seas, with a Penſion of Twenty Thouſand Sequins of Gold. He has moreover made magnificent Preſents to the Dutcheſs his Wife, eſteemed at an Hundred Thouſand Crowns; and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46436:117"/>beſides, made Knights of the Order of St. <hi>James,</hi> ſeveral Gentlemen of this Princes Court.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> has alſo given ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſplendid Entertainments in his Houſe and State for the Marriage conſummated with the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Son; and whilſt I am writing, I am told, there is a Son born to this King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> now Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> But whilſt theſe Rejoycings are in ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> an unforeſeen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt has ruined whole Countries in <hi>Germany;</hi> the Damage done thereby in <hi>Franconia,</hi> and near <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> is incredible: And it lackt but little, but this ſame King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> now mentioned, being at the hunting of a Boar, had been ſlain through a Whirlwind; which having pull'd up a great Oak by the Roots, of prodigious Greatneſs, fell ſo near this Prince, that he received ſome ſlight Hurt by a Branch of it.</p>
                  <p>I pray Heavens, that all the Wiſdom of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, and the Bleſſing of the Great God be always upon thee, and in thee, and ever augment thy Strength and good Fortune, to the Ruin of theſe <hi>Perſian</hi> Hereticks, whoſe Country I hope will be ſubjected by thy Sword to our Dread Emperor.</p>

                  <p>I have neither good nor bad News of thee, no more than of thy new Spouſe: God grant the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Greek</hi> thou art married to, have the Vices of thy firſt Husband, my Father.

                  <p>I thank thee not for my Life, for that is what thou leaſt thought of, when thou becameſt big with me.

Engrave theſe Words in thy Heart: <hi>Love ever what is honeſt, and hate always what is contrary to it.</hi> Thus will theſe different Paſſions be ſetled on their proper Objects.</p>
                  <p>If my Brother <hi>Peſteli</hi> be ſtill alive, give him my Love with an innocent Kiſs, and a Touch in the Hand. Our Great Prophet protect and ſuſtain thy Age with the Staff of Mount <hi>Liban,</hi> and obtain

                  <p>SHould I tell thee I am in Health, I ſhall write an untruth; for I am really out of order, and expect a Fit of Sickneſs; which I wiſh 'twere in my Power to avoid, though it may prove ſhort and mortal. An Hectic Fever puts me oft in mind, how frail and brittle a thing is Man; and that he ought in Multiplicity of Buſineſs, in Times of Proſperity as well as Adverſity, to think of diſlodging hence. The Bread I eat has no Reliſh; Solitude appears diſmal to me, and Company wearies me; for I
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46436:119"/>cannot attend to what's diſcourſed, and yet I do not like they ſhould ſay nothing; there's nothing pleaſes me but Drink, yet all the Sea will not quench my Thirſt. I am reſtleſs in Bed, and find my ſelf more tired thereby, than if I ſat up; and that which I loved Yeſterday, I hate to day. Thou knoweſt how I loved Books, this Humour is quite changed. If the Sun ſhines into my Chamber, I as ſoon ſhut my Windows, being not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it; and having remained a Minute in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I am impatient for the Light. <hi>Paris,</hi> where one may ſay Strangers come from all parts, to ſee the Varieties and Diverſions there to be met with, appears to me now an Hoſpital of Fools: I long for nothing more than <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to be with my Friends, imagining I ſhall find eaſe in their Company. And this is the unhappy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Friend, without hope of ſeeing any more <hi>Turbans</hi> and <hi>Muſſelmen.</hi> I loth as much the ſight of an ignorant Phyſician, as the Emperor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> did a corrupt Judge, and I look on a little Valet that ſerves me, as a neceſſary Evil: Yet I'll a little divert thee, maugre the Illneſs which has ſeiz'd me. 'Tis not above Six Months ſince I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained this Enemy in my Houſe, which is a <hi>French</hi> Valet, who makes himſelf a Fool; of a Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Stature, yet a Gyant in Roguery; he is clad like the <hi>Graces,</hi> being half naked, and wears Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins like the Poetical Divinities; his ordinary Function is to ſweep every day my Chamber, which yet is as naſty as <hi>Augis</hi> his Stable; when I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake he's aſleep, and he's always awake when I am aſleep; for this Thirteen Years that he has ſeen the Light, he cannot remember he has been two Hours without eating: When he eats not openly and before Folks, leſt he ſhould ſhame me; he will yet be ſure to keep his Chaps a going, on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46436:120"/>in Corners. When I went abroad, I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to follow him; and now that I keep my Bed, 'tis hard to judge which of us two is the Maſter, for he never parts with his Hat from his Head. He's more ready to pull off my Cloaths, than to put them on; which makes me chiefly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him at ſuch times, that he leaves me not ſtark naked. He's moreover a Politician, as much as any <hi>Florentin:</hi> When he's to do any good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he falls into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pace, but to perfect a bad one, he's as nimble as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Expeditions; whence it is that I am a Debtor to my own Arm and Hand for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I draw from him, being like certain Drugs which never yield an Odor till well beaten: As to his Religion, a Man would imagin he held the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempſycoſis,</hi> ſo carefully does he preſerve the Lice that eat him, leſt in killing them he act contrary to the Precepts of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> He is moreover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an irreconcilable Enemy to all Neatneſs, to Water, and to Truth; and he is more ſtinking than a Synagogue, drunker than a <hi>Swiſs,</hi> and a greater Lyer than any Oracle. In the mean time my Illneſs encreaſes, and my Domeſtic Enemy is ſo well, that he aſſuredly waits my Death, to live more Honourably on my Spoils. I differ much this Day from what I was Yeſterday; and I know not whether I ſhall not to morrow go to my long Home. Pray the Immortal for me, and remember we were once in Slavery together. Should I eſcape, I ſhall have the Joy of never ſeeing thee in the ſad condition I am; and if cannot eſcape Death at this time, I ſhall have the ſatisfaction of ſuffering it before thee. However, believe I do not deſpair, though I much complain.

                  <p>Sir, I am a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> although my Parents be <hi>Turks.</hi> If thou willingly receiveſt me for thy Slave, I receive thee yet more willingly for my Maſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt and merciful Prince: But I am obliged to tell thee, That if thou wilt behave thy ſelf like a Maſter, whoſe Liberality is guided by Prudence, thou wilt never do me any Hurt, nor ever do me any great Good. Shouldſt thou give me Opportunities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Riches, and throw open the Gate of Honours to me: I ſhall thereby, perhaps, become vicious and inſolent. Beſtow only one thing on me, which will not be afterwards in thy Power to take away; Give me good Education, and let a Man of Learning take the Charge of me, by which means I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of Nature, in making me but an Atome of a Man; and perhaps make thy Courtiers, one day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their preſent Laughter at me.</p>

                  <p>I have been ſick during the ſpace of Eighteen Moons, and my Health is not yet fully reſtored: I have lived all that time, in continual expectation of Death, and ſo many odd things have hapned in my Sickneſs, that I ſhould fall into it again, ſhouldſt thou oblige me to make the Recital of them.</p>
                  <p>The Charity of the <hi>Chriſtian Dervices</hi> has been very great towards me, having neglected nothing which might be any ways ſerviceable to my happy Departure. The graveſt of them have often attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with Diſcourſes of the Immortality of the Soul, of Hell, their Purgatory, Paradice, and the Merits and Indulgences of the <hi>Church.</hi> Several Phyſicians have come to ſee me, and uſed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Skill to keep me alive, and imagin I owe my Life to them; but if it be ſo, they have paid themſelves for their Care, by drawing ſo much Blood out of me, having, I think, quite emptyed my Veins, to reſiſt, ſaid they, the ſeveral Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which aſſaulted me, and to take from me the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fever which I nouriſhed; for I aſſuredly brought it from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greateſt Sin I committed during the Courſe of ſo long a Sickneſs, was the pretending to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to a <hi>Captain Dervis,</hi> as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do in the principal Feaſts, and when they are ready to dye. I uſed this Ceremony but once, and I do not think I have committed Sacrilege, for I have told no Truth; and if I may ſpeak freely to thee, Invincible <hi>Vizir,</hi> hear what a pleaſant Penance was enjoyned me, for an imaginary Crime of which I accuſed my ſelf.

                  <p>Yet the Place was ſurrendred, before the Spring time was come to change the Face of the Earth, ſo far were they from holding out till 'twas cover'd with Snow or Ice.</p>

                  <p>The War has been very cruel in <hi>Italy,</hi> between the three Parties, who are extreamly animated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another.

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have made a great Noiſe in the Ocean with their Fleets; the former came with Fourſcore Veſſels of War to land Fifteen Thouſand Men in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but having been met by <hi>Van Tromp,</hi> a Commander of great Courage and Experience, there was a bloody Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fought, which laſted long, but at length ended in the Defeat of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> have taken Thirteen Ships, and about Twenty of them have been driven by the Weather on the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> where they are loſt, and eight others have had the good Fortune to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>

                  <p>I Am in a manner raiſed from the Dead, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Letter; there is not a Line or Syllable, but ſhews the Marks of a true Heart, and a tender and real Sympathy with my Condition: I pray Heaven, we may do nothing either of us to leſſen this Affection.</p>
                  <p>Thou informeſt me in thy Letter of the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Iſouf</hi> for <hi>Mecha:</hi> I give thee a Thouſand Thanks for the Mony thou haſt given him, for the offering of a Sacrifice in my Name on the <hi>Sacred Mountain,</hi> and to diſtribute here below the Alms which I enjoyned him. I admire thy Bounty, and the Charitable Care thou haſt had of the Salvation of thy Friend <hi>Mahmut,</hi> in ſending one of our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes</hi> to <hi>Medina,</hi> to go the Pilgrimage, and ſay the Prayers for me. In a Word, I ſee thy Kindneſs makes thee foreſee and provide againſt all my Wants; there is no Place or Time, wherein I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not Marks of thy Favour.</p>
                  <p>Seeing I am ſo dear to thee, and loving thee ſo greatly as I do, let not diſtance of Place, Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Diſgrace, Impriſonment; or any other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune extinguiſh, or ſo much as damp our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affection.</p>
                  <p>I have in a manner, ſtole the time I write to thee: for I have nothing which is truly mine, and I make thee a Preſent of a thing which I owed the <hi>Kaimakan,</hi> for whom I ought to employ more time in writing. But let us lay aſide all theſe troubleſom Affairs, and entertain one another with an entire Confidence and Familiarity. Thou wanteſt not Wit, employ it in the Study of Hiſtory, after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46436:126"/>Inſtruction in the Matters which concern Religion. If thou wilt be a Prince among other Men, ſeparate thy ſelf from the Croud, by thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to good Authors; read much, and yet read little; read ever good Books, there being few of them, and thus thou wilt read much. If thou canſt attain to the Knowledg of whatever is known of Men, thou wilt be a kind of God amongſt them; whereas thou wilt be of the number of Beaſts, if thou faileſt of acquiring the Notices thou oughteſt to have. I wiſh thou wouldſt mind more for thy Friends ſake, what paſſes in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> in the <hi>Divan,</hi> and in the Prince's moſt ſecret Councils, to know what is ſaid there againſt me and for me: Good and ſeaſonable Advice does oftentimes hinder much Miſchief, and does a great deal of good. Friendſhip makes thoſe things which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hard, very eaſie: He that is not ready (ſays an Holy Man amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) to ſuffer all things, and to loſe all, and his very Will too, for the ſake of him that he loves, deſerves not the Name of a Friend.</p>
                  <p>Let us ever forget the Words <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>thine:</hi> Thy good Fortune is mine, even as thy Diſgraces are: If we thus eſtabliſh our Friendſhip, why may we not, though Modern <hi>Turks,</hi> compare our ſelves to thoſe Antient <hi>Greeks,</hi> who have given ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Marks to the World of their Friendſhip? Why may we not be the Imitators of <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who contracted ſo ſtrict an Union, that nothing could change it? Although we were not born the ſame Day, in the ſame Climat, and in the ſame Town as <hi>Poliſtratus</hi> and <hi>Hypoclides,</hi> who were born in the ſame Houſe, at the ſame Hour, and lived always together, and fell ſick at the ſame Time, and loved equally; yet let us ſurpaſs them in Affection. Love we one another more than <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Piritohus;</hi> more than <hi>Damon</hi> and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46436:127"/>
                     <hi>Pithias;</hi> the former of which contracted in Arms, and the other in Studies, that ſtrict Amity that has rendred them ſo recommendable to Poſterity. If thou knoweſt any Secret whereby to reſtore my Appetite which I have loſt, ſend it me. I am here Spectator of a Million of Mouths, who eat four times a day, and conſume 15000 Oxen every Week, and 15000 other Pieces of Animals, beſides Mutton, Veal, Hogs, not to reckon all ſorts of Fowl, and Fruits produced by the Earth, and the Fiſhes from the Seas and Rivers.</p>
                  <p>I am forced to dye with Hunger with my Meat in my Hands; and in a Town where there is an Abundance of all ſorts of things, I want all things. Bread which is ſo pleaſant to the Eye, and ſo ſavoury in the Taſt, to all other People, is nauſeated by me. Wine only, becauſe 'tis forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by our Law, rejoyces the ſight of me, and ſtirs up a deſire of drinking. Let me hear oft from thee; let thy Letters be inſtructive, and be levelled againſt my melancholy Temper. The God of <hi>Mahmut</hi> keep thee ever in Health, and make thee love me, as thou doſt, continually.</p>

                  <p>THou art as lazy in writing, as inconſiderable in thy Judgment of things. Thou haſt written to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> That this <hi>Republick</hi> is diſpoſed to joyn its Forces to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> for its Aſſiſtance in the War againſt the <hi>Port;</hi> but what
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46436:127"/>Ground haſt thou for this Advice? And if the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> ſhould oblige thee to give a Reaſon for this, how canſt thou ſatisfie his Curioſity and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from accuſing thee of great Lightneſs?</p>
                  <p>I now receiv'd a Copy of the Letter thou didſt write to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for which I thank thee: 'Twould have been better I had received the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; for I would not have ſent it. There's no likelyhood that a <hi>Republick,</hi> ſo deſirous of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Peace in her Dominions, will diſturb her own Quiet, for the Service of a State with which ſhe is always at War.</p>
                  <p>Had the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> any Cauſe of Complaint againſt <hi>Amurath,</hi> they would want neither Soldiers, nor Arms, nor Veſſels, nor Mony to raiſe Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.

                     </hi>) War in the <hi>Spaniſh Indies</hi> with their Regiſters, and Arithmetick; and they have always the Advantage in this kind of Combat, wherein there is no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they ever loſt: Let this Nation alone in Peace.

                  </p>
                  <p>Tell the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> That ſo many extravagant Philoſohers, who continually ſearch for what they will never find, have at length ſhewed, That there is no other Place where are more perfect Chymiſts to be found, having converted into Gold almoſt all the Stones of their Country, changed the Horror of their Deſarts into moſt pleaſant Gardens; and the Cottages of the ancient <hi>Ligurians</hi> are transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Pallaces, enriched with Marble and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, with ſo great Magnificence and Propriety, that no Houſes are comparable to theirs. To which thou mayſt add, That the Inheritance of the pooreſt

                     <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> does at this time much ſurpaſs thoſe of their Predeceſſors.

                  <p>Be more careful of what thou writeſt for the Future; and when thou giveſt Advice, ſet down what thou knoweſt without Exaggeratings, and be reſerved in what's doubtful: Never write Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods in thy Diſpatches.

                  <p>THE <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are become Magicians, or to ſpeak better, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who make War in <hi>Piemont,</hi> have fill'd the World with Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by an extraordinary and new Enchantment. I wrote to thee, there were two great Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Turin,</hi> one to take it, and the other to ſuccour it; but I have not yet made known to thee, that the Canon of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are become Couriers, who carry their Diſpatches in the Air, into the beſieged Cities; and moreover, Ammunition, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Salt-Petre, and Mony; a marvellous Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which fills me with Admiration in writing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46436:128"/>it. There is a Man in the Camp of General <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez,</hi> who makes braſs Bullets ſo artificially, that having ſhot them into the Ditch of the Place, they have for a long time ſuccoured the Beſieged. 'Tis ſaid, that being made in a Vice, and hollowed within, they have ſerved for two Uſes, to convey into <hi>Turin</hi> what was wanting, and to bring back into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Camp the things they moſt needed. But this Induſtry proved in the end uſeleſs; for after ſeveral Conflicts, <hi>Turin</hi> has faln again into the Hands of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reſtabliſhed the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the great ſatisfaction of her People, who have thereupon ſhewed the Signs of the greateſt Joy. This Reſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment is owing to the Valour and Conduct of Count <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who has ſuſtained and repelled the Aſſaults of two Armies, ſtronger in number than his own. This Captain, has made his Name as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in <hi>Italy,</hi> as were heretofore thoſe of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> The Marquiſs of <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nez</hi> undertook the Siege of <hi>Cazal,</hi> an important Place belonging to the Duke of <hi>Mantoa,</hi> ſituated on the famous River of <hi>Po</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Count <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> being not able with all his Army to put Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours into the place, he took the Party of forcing himſelf the Beſieged, entring on Horſeback into the Lines with his Sword in his Hand, where he was followed by ſome of his Gentlemen. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſurprized and aſtoniſht, found no Safety but in Retreat, which they made diſorderly; and the <hi>French</hi> under ſuch a Captain, bore away that day, the greateſt and moſt glorious Victory they ever won in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou requireſt an Account of me of what has paſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> I can tell thee, that the War has been carryed on there this Year with equal Succeſs and Loſſes to both Parties, to whom Fortune has been ſometimes favourable, and otherwhiles contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:46436:129"/>
                  <p>But I am informed, there's a deſign of making a great Aſſembly at <hi>Cologn,</hi> to reſtabliſh a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> has named for his <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> there, the Cardinal <hi>Julius Mazarin,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> by Nation, a Man of great Parts, and Experience in Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> is ſet at Liberty, at the Intreaty of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> his Brother, and been ſince well received by the King, who made him Dine at his Table, and preſented him with a rich Diamond. The Town of <hi>Arras,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> have taken in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> is of great Importance, and is a conſiderable loſs to the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, who will give great Reputation to his Enemies, that have taken the Place in the ſight of a great Army, commanded by the <hi>Cardinal Infant,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> which Conqueſt has mightily raiſed the <hi>French</hi> Courage, and encreaſed the Glory of their Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Queen is brought to Bed of a Second Son, who was born the 21ſt of <hi>September,</hi> and he is named the Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are as unfortunate on the Sea, as at Land. Their Fleet, which return'd from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> richly laden with Commodities of all ſorts, have been moſt of them diſperſed by the <hi>French</hi> Naval Army, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Breze.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> truly fought with much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but Fifteen Thouſand of their Men were ſlain, and Two Hundred taken Priſoners, together with Five great Veſſels richly laden. One of their great Gallions was burnt, and it is ſaid, the other Ships were ſaved, having firſt thrown the beſt part of their Lading overboard, which they had brought with ſuch great Care and Pains from the <hi>other World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which has paſt on the Ocean, has not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> from ſhewing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46436:129"/>the Strength of the King his Maſter on the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean;</hi> where he has fought an Occaſion, of fighting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a lighter Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting for the moſt part of Gallies. He had ſent a Defiance to the Duke <hi>de Ferrandine,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies; who being unwilling to accept of the Challenge, this Prelate advanced towards the Coaſts of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he did ſome Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>One may ſay, That the Misfortunes of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> are as great this Year, as his Power is. But it is ſaid, theſe Loſſes are not comparable to what he is threatned with, if <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia</hi> ſhake off the Yoak of his Domination, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report runs.</p>
                  <p>I have heard much talk in General, on theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Affairs, without being however informed of any certain Particulars. But henceforward, when I ſhall be able to leave my Chamber, to go into the Churches, Walks and Gardens about the City and the Court, I ſhall let nothing paſs without a ſtrict Enquiry, and give a Faithful Account of whatever deſerves thy Notice; and ſhouldſt thou deſire any particular thing of thy Slave <hi>Mahmut,</hi> 'tis but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning it, and thou ſhalt not want an exact and humble Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>THe Lovely <hi>Greek,</hi> after whom thou enquireſt ſo earneſtly, is long ſince retired into <hi>France,</hi> and has been married Eighty Moons to a great <hi>French</hi> Merchant, with whom I am not acquainted, but am informed is very rich, and fortunate in his Dealings; but infinitely more fortunate in being the Husband of <hi>Daria Lena Maani,</hi> by whom he has ſeveral fine Children.</p>
                  <p>This charming <hi>Greek</hi> does now profeſs the <hi>Romnn</hi> Religion, which is the only Fault I find in her; I never knew Woman, whoſe whole Carriage is ſo graceful, who does all things with ſuch a careleſs exactneſs, and whoſe Virtue is leſs moroſe. Meer Chance brought me acquainted with her, whom I no ſooner ſaw, but was ſtruck with Admiration. She came to <hi>Paris</hi> the laſt Year, to ſollicit a Law-Suit againſt a Stranger about an Eſtate. It was at Court, and in the preſence of the King himſelf that I firſt ſaw <hi>Daria;</hi> ſhe ſpake to him ſo ſweetly, that ſhe ſoon obtained what ſhe deſired; and at the ſame inſtant I felt ſuch inexpreſſible Paſſions and Longings after her Acquaintance—Suffer me, my dear <hi>Dgnet,</hi> to tell thee, that never any Creature made ſuch deep Impreſſions in the Heart of a Man, as this charming <hi>Greek did in mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I drew near to her as ſoon as I could; I ſpake to her in her own Language, telling her, I was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian;</hi> and ſhe anſwered me, with as great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty as Benignity. I went the day following to give her a Viſit in her own Lodgings; where this adorable Perſon, received me with the greateſt Civility, not forbidding me a Return; being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46436:130"/>perhaps to meet with one, that could ſpeak her own Language, which is very rare in theſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>Since then, I could not for my Life forget her; I have ſerved her with the greateſt Diligence, and ſo doted on her, that I forgot my ſelf and thee, and if I may dare to ſay ſo, the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> too. Pardon this Infidelity on the account of a Paſſion, which knows no Moderation, being not able to withſtand the Force of ſo invincible an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daria</hi> is young, of a generous Temper, and in whoſe whole Deportment, there's no Grace want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Her Vertue is far above <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s, for this <hi>Roman</hi> Lady killed her ſelf, having firſt endured the violences of a Tyrant; whereas ſhe would dye before ſhe would come to ſuch a Tryal. If you have ſeen her at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> you muſt have known her Perfections: I, for my part, who only knew her at <hi>Paris,</hi> have remark four Beauties in her Perſon, which I believe is not to be found in any of thoſe Ladies kept in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Her Eyes, her Mouth, her Teeth, and her Hands, ſeem to have been made only to furniſh the God of Love with Darts. She is ſure to ſtrike where ſhe will, with her fine black Eyes full of Fire: and ſhe has alſo the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of healing the Wounds ſhe makes, when ſhe pleaſes. As ſoon as ever ſhe opens her Mouth, the three <hi>Graces</hi> are ſeen to ſit ſporting in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and her Body is moreover ſo proportion'd in all its parts, that had ſhe lived in the time of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> he had certainly taken her for the Model of his <hi>Venus,</hi> which was the Admiration of all the World.</p>
                  <p>I have plyed this fair <hi>Greek</hi> with Viſits, loved her even to Idolatry; my Reſpect has been ever equal to her Virtue; and the greateſt Favour I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from her, was to ſuffer me thus to ſpeak to her; <hi>I love you,</hi> Daria; Daria, <hi>I adore you;</hi> but ſhe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46436:131"/>would never ſuffer the leaſt Expreſſion which might make her underſtand any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>This incomparable Beauty often ſaid to me; Mahmut; <hi>I have a great Reſpect for thee, becauſe thou art diſcreet and vertuous, and ſhould alſo love thee, wert thou not a Man. Live on ſtill as thou haſt done, and thou wilt thereby oblige me to reſpect thee yet more; but think not to obtain from</hi> Daria <hi>any more than an innocent Affection; I owe all to my Husband, and I will never be unfaithful to him.</hi> If I ever attempted to ſnatch any ſmall Favour, it was always in vain, having ever repelled me in ſuch a manner as made me loſe all Hope, and at the ſame time feel a new increaſe of Paſſion. Conſider, Dear <hi>Oglou,</hi> what paſt then in my Heart, and what a War I was to ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p>In my great Inquietudes, and ſharpeſt and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt Pains, <hi>Philoſophy</hi> ſupplyed me with no other Remedies but Patience; ſhe ſet before me the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Eſteem which the <hi>Ancients</hi> had for Pudicity; but ſhe hindred me not from alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that we find in Hiſtory almoſt all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> more tranſported with Venereal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, than retained by the Precepts of Wiſdom: <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> became they not Fools here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? And <hi>Seneca,</hi> whoſe <hi>Morals</hi> are the Rules of the Wiſeſt, was not he driven out of <hi>Rome</hi> for his Adulteries? I tell thee plainly, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> have influenced me not a whit; I derided them, and was reſolved to love on, and that more exceſſively than all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> together. <hi>Daria</hi>'s ſoft Severity has laid on me ſtronger Laws than all the Dogms of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> ſo that nothing can make me change my Reſolution of loving her eternally. If it be true that Love is a Weakneſs, only Men, who are noble Creatures, are thereunto ſubject; it being certain, that mean Souls cannot love, becauſe they have no Heart: <hi>Natures Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46436:131"/>is far higher than Reaſons;</hi> one is the Work of God, whereas the other comes from Man. Be not then aſtoniſht if Reaſon does ſo oft yield to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daria</hi> had a mind to learn <hi>Italian,</hi> which ſhe thought a better Language than others. I taught her a great deal of it in a little time, but buſineſs quickly deprived an unhappy Maſter, of the moſt perfect of Scholars. She ſaid once to me, <hi>Mahmut,</hi> let us have a perpetual Amity for one another, but let us love and eſteem Vertue far before Friendſhip. Teach me <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Geography,</hi> to the end that knowing Kingdoms, Towns, and Provinces, and thoſe that govern them; I may know into how many Parts, this Earth which appears ſo admirable, is divided; I may now learn the Forces, Methods of Government, Manners, Religions of Nations, the difference of Seas and of Mountains, of Lakes and Rivers, of inhabited Places, Iſlands and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, that I may not confound the barbarous with the civilized Nations, and <hi>Republicks</hi> with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My worthy Friend, ſo noble an Inclination joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a ſingular Grace, and attended with ſo many rare Qualities, as well Spiritual as Corporal, have reduced the poor <hi>Mahmut</hi> to a Slavery, more rigorous than that which he ſuffered with thee in <hi>Sicily.</hi> How many Nights have I paſt in horrible Reſtleſneſs; and how many times have I vainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I was with <hi>Daria,</hi> whom I ſought in my Chamber; when Sleep ſucceeding long Watchings, repreſented her to me in a Dream more complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant than ordinary? In a Word, <hi>Daria</hi> ſo filled my Thoughts, that I forgot my Books, and avoided alſo the Company of my Friends; ſhe alone was my daily Study, and I renounced all other Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements; the fineſt Ladies were nauſeous to me; the fineſt Gardens ſeemed horrible Foreſts, which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46436:132"/>ſerve for a Retreat to Savage Beaſts. In fine, my Paſſion (Friend <hi>Oglou</hi>) comes to that Exceſs, that I can find no Remedy. My Tears were of none effect to ſoften <hi>Daria,</hi> and I have caſt my ſelf a Thouſand times in vain at her Feet; all my Cares and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects have ſerved only to give me Proofs of her Virtue. Receive as thou oughteſt the Confidence I put in thee, and if thou haſt not an Heart that can love ſo ardently, at leaſt have ſome complacency towards a man whoſe Paſſion has no Bounds, and reproach me not with having had too much Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for having been vanquiſht by a Woman. 'Tis Women that have always won the greateſt Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; it is their Trade to conquer, and even thoſe too, who ſubdue all things. It is impoſſible for me to comprehend how I could love ſo ſtrongly without dying, neither can I imagine how I ſhall live, if I be long deprived of the Sight of her I love. <hi>Daria</hi> has left <hi>Paris,</hi> and is diſtant thence above Three Hundred Miles; conſider then the condition I am in. I reckon my ſelf in a ſolitary place, although there be above a Million of Inhabitants in the Town where I dwell. I ſtir not out of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and as to my Books, they will yield me no Comfort. My only Care is to nouriſh my Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; whereby I ſtudy to make my ſelf more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe it is not in my power ſo much as to ſeek the way to the only Happineſs I wiſh for. <hi>Mahmut</hi> may be ſaid to be the Son of Sorrow; my Beard is naſty and overgrown; I am out of love with my ſelf, comfortleſs, avoiding all Society, and am become inviſible to all People. I have no Hope amongſt ſo many Cauſes of Deſpair, but the Aſſurance which <hi>Daria</hi> has given me, that I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a place in her Heart, and I believe it, becauſe ſhe ſays ſo. Heaven has given her a frank and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Soul, and promiſes her great things in the courſe of her Life. I have ſecretly drawn her
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46436:132"/>Horoſcope, as as far as I could find, all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are favourable to her; ſhe is to live a great while; Fortune will ſecond her Intentions; ſhe will enjoy an uninterrupted Health; and this lovely Perſon will ever gain the Advantage on all that ſhall oppoſe her. Happy is he that ſhall be of the number of her Friends, but more happy is he that ſhall be beloved of her, for he may aſſure himſelf of being beloved of the handſomeſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Lady in the World.</p>
                  <p>Read my Follies with ſome Indulgence, and be not angry with me when thou knoweſt, I was ready to renounce my Religion for that of <hi>Daria</hi>'s; ſhe began to convince me, and I began to believe that the Religion of the moſt perfect and moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous of Women was the beſt. If thou haſt Intereſt enough in the <hi>Grand Viſir,</hi> or the <hi>Kaimakan,</hi> obtain for me the Permiſſion of leaving <hi>Paris</hi> for Six. Months only, but by no means let them know the Occaſion. I love much, abſent from <hi>Daria,</hi> but it ſeems to me I do not yet love enough: I would have more violent Tranſports, during her Abſence, than thoſe I ſuffer whilſt I ſee her; to the end I may ſay, that at all times, and in all places, never any body loved ſo much. I have diſcovered to thee my whole Heart, excuſe my Paſſion, if thou wilt not excuſe thy Friend ſo horridly tormented with it; and remember what the Beautiful <hi>Roxalana</hi> ſaid to the great <hi>Solyman, That the Pleaſure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and making one's ſelf obeyed, is to bereckoned but in the ſecond Rank of Pleaſures, whereas that of loving and being beloved is the firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was one of the greateſt Kings of <hi>France,</hi> than whom no man ever more greatly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. When he reproached the Duke <hi>de Biron</hi> with the Love he had for a Lady, mark what this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilier told him; <hi>Great King, how is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt not be indulgent to Lovers, who haſt ſo often
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:46436:133"/>ſaid when thou waſt in love, thou forgatteſt thy ſelf, thy Kingdom and Subjects?</hi> And this, dear <hi>Oglou,</hi> is what has happened to me at <hi>Paris</hi> with this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon whom thou couldſt no longer find at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But alas, I ſhould be an unhappy Friend, if with ſuch a Love a mine I ſhould prove thy Rival. I will not imagin it; yet I muſt tell thee, that rather than yield thee <hi>Daria,</hi> I will ſacrifice to thee all the time I have to live. I have given my Picture to this charming <hi>Greek,</hi> who has received it very courteouſly, yet rather as the Work of an excellent Painter, than the Picture of a Lover.</p>
                  <p>But being full of Goodneſs, and perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, ſhe ſaid thus to me, when I gave it her: Mahmut, <hi>thank Heaven thou art not handſom; ſuch ſort of Men have not ordinarily all the ſucceſs they pretend to in their Amours. Wiſe Ladies think theſe kind of People doat too much on themſelves; and thoſe that are diſdainful, find them not ſubmiſſive enough and reſpectful; and ſuch as fear evil Tongues, dare not look on them; and alſo theſe Gentlemen imagin Ladies Favours are granted them, becauſe they cannot withſtand them, and they expect oftentimes to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to receive them: Whereas thoſe to whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not been ſo liberal of her Favours, do more than bare love; they adore their Miſtreſſes, they are always humble, and know how to gain the coyeſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by their Reſpectfulneſs. As to thy part, who art none of the faireſt, thou wilt be happy, if thou chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt not thy manner of living with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for me to ſay, whether <hi>Daria</hi> has any conſiderable Imperfections, being too greatly prepoſſeſſed by my Paſſion, to diſcover De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in a Perſon, whom I regard as an Angel. Time and her Promiſes, will one day ſhew me, whether ſhe has the Vices uſual to thoſe of her Nation, which are commonly an Infidelity, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46436:133"/>over with the moſt ſpecious Pretences, and a continued Diſſimulation.</p>
                  <p>However, ſend me a Cask of the white Balm of <hi>Mecha,</hi> and of the beſt ſort for Scent thou canſt get; and at the ſame time, ſend me alſo ſome of that precious <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Wood, whoſe Scent is admirable to perfume the Body. I have promiſed the fair <hi>Daria</hi> this Preſent; let me ſoon have it, to the end I may accuſtom <hi>Daria</hi> to the Neatneſs and Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> Preſerve alſo thy Health, and if thou envieſt me, love as much as I do: but love with Continency, if thou wilt love long, and be long beloved.</p>
                  <p>The Great <hi>God</hi> preſerve thee from loving how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo exceſſively as thy Friend <hi>Mahmut</hi> does; the Dolors being therein always certain, and the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uncertain.</p>

                  <p>But he was not thus received at Court, where the King and his Miniſters do all things with great Prudence; being reſpected as a Man that brought good News, and ſent by the greateſt and moſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Emperor in the World.

                  <p>SInce I received thy Letter, and the marks of thy Remembrance, I imagin my ſelf much better. I make two Meals a day, I walk about in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my Appetite increaſes, I have no more of thoſe nauſeous Belches, I can read longer, and I ſleep a-nights more ſoundly. Yet I cannot ſay I am in perfect Health; ſo long an Illneſs has deprived me of that which I do not find return. There's wanting to my Intellectual Faculties a certain kind of Vivacity, and Readineſs in their Operations, which is extreamly abated; but I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be an Effect of the Pain I ſuffered, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it comes not from Nature weakned; as faſt as our Life advances to throw it ſelf, as it were, into the Arms of Death, which is what is moſt certain for me. I would willingly entertain thee on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein I find my ſelf, could I overcome the Weakneſs of my Diſpoſition, and the Coldneſs of the Seaſon, which pierces me, maugre all my care to prevent it in this Icy Climate. The Ink I write with freezes on my Pen, and a Body may ſay, the Fire freezes too, wanting, as it does, its uſual activity; the Cold being ſo ſharp, that it extinguiſhes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat. The City where I dwell, appears on a ſudden transformed into Cryſtal; the Northern
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46436:135"/>Wind has in one night frozen the River; and all the Fountains, which were wont to quench the Thirſt of a Million of People, are dried up. All Trade ſeems to have ceaſed, the Rich are retired to their Fires, and the Poor are creeping about the Streets; where, notwithſtanding the Exerciſes they uſe to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Cold, they ſeem already ſtarved. The Bread is become like Marble, or an hard Stone; all things are frozen, and ancient People affirm, never the like has happened in their Days, or in the Times of their Fathers. There has been found ſome few Miles from <hi>Paris,</hi> in the great Road, two Men clad in very courſe Stuff, without Shifts, their Legs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Heads ſhaved, and Cords about their middle, dead with Cold. They were found embracing one another, thinking thereby to communicate mutual Heat, to keep off, or at leaſt, retard their Deaths. Theſe People are <hi>Derviſes</hi> of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, which are called <hi>Capucins;</hi> whoſe Life is a continual Penance; they riſe in the Night to their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpend their time in Contemplation. They live upon Alms which they receive of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which conſiſt of Bread, Roots, and Herbs; and if the Charity of theſe <hi>Nazarenes</hi> extends to the giving any thing more, they uſe it with Sobriety. They ſleep on Straw, and are obliged to wear the Habit Night and Day, which is dreadful to look on, and in which they are buried when they die. When their Occaſions require them to travel, they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go on Horſeback, in a Coach, or Chair, but only in Veſſels when they go by Sea, or on Rivers; ſo that they have only that granted them, which <hi>Cato</hi> was ſo afraid of, and every body elſe but Fools; which is, To Travel by Water.</p>
                  <p>In fine, their Life is accounted a continual Hell; and they will be finely chouſed, if they find not a Heaven, when ſtripp'd of their Mortality.</p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:46436:136"/>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Religious</hi> are under the direction of one <hi>General;</hi> obſerve a long Silence, which is a great Vertue amongſt them; and with this are ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient to their <hi>Head,</hi> that they have no Will left.</p>
                  <p>They have very obſcure Priſons under Ground, wherein they thruſt thoſe who ſcandalize their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> by their Crimes: For, notwithſtanding the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Rule, and the Vigilancy of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, to make it obſerved; there's never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome who wander from the right way, and often make uſe of the Eſteem which Men have of their Piety, to commit ſuch Enormities as would be ſoundly puniſhed by the Men of the World. Theſe kind of <hi>Derviſes</hi> cannot handle Money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being guilty of a mortal Sin. Notwithſtanding this Profeſſion of Poverty, I have ſeen theſe <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi> dreſt up with greater magnificence than our <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In their Sacrifice, they eat the <hi>conſecrated Bread,</hi> which they call the <hi>Meſſias his Body;</hi> which they are wont to place on a Plate of fine Gold; and they alſo put into Cups of the ſame Metal a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which they ſay is changed into the <hi>Blood of their God,</hi> as the Bread into the <hi>Body,</hi> aſſoon as they have pronounced certain Words, which they ſecretly mutter.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrifice is offered every day, and not only the People are preſent at it, but the greateſt of the Kingdom, with their Monarch on his Knees, and in a ſupplicating poſture. There ſtand about the Altar ſeveral ſtately Candleſticks, wherein burn white Wax Candles, which renders the Sacrifice ſtill more ſolemn.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:46436:136"/>
                  <p>I relate to thee what I have often ſeen; for I chooſe to be frequently in theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> Churches, and at their ſolemn Feſtivals, the better to conceal who I am.</p>
                  <p>Yet happy is he that lives ſatisfied with himſelf, aſſured he ſerves <hi>God</hi> in the manner he will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

I expect, with great impatience, the Seaſon which o'reſpreads the Gardens with Flowers, the Fields with Graſs, and crowns the Trees with Bloſſoms, and brings back the pretty Birds, who publiſh the joyful News of the Spring's approach; that being the Time wherein I may expect my Health.</p>

                  <p>THE Court of <hi>France</hi> is an Aſſembly of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians who diſcover, or hide themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Intereſts; and are more wont to hold their peace, than to talk. They explain themſelves in more than one manner, on the things which they cannot conceal; and, I draw from them what is neceſſary for my Inſtruction, and thy Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There have happened ſuch ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Motions in <hi>Spain,</hi> as cauſe conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be hoped for by <hi>France,</hi> which ſeems to have had a great hand in them; on which thou maiſt make what Reflexions thou thinkeſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>The Mountains which divide <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> are called the <hi>Pirenees. Catalonia</hi> is a Province wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on one hand by the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, and bounded by <hi>Navarr;</hi> it lies ſituated at the Foot of theſe Mountains: The People have taken up Arms, and vigorouſly oppoſed the <hi>Catholick</hi> King's Miniſters; and the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have done the ſame thing, but with different Succeſs. This Kingdom is compriſed within the States of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the richeſt under her Dominion. Her Situation is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, lying between <hi>Galicia</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and watered with the Ocean, which brings her immenſe Riches.</p>
                  <p>The principal Town of <hi>Catalonia</hi> is <hi>Barcellona;</hi> and <hi>Lisbon</hi> is the chief Town of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The firſt has taken for the pretence of its Inſurrection, the Inſolencies committed by the <hi>Protestant</hi> Troops, which ſerved the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, and were quartered in this Province. And the other, having long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46436:137"/>its Deſign, has at length ſhaked off the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Yoak, and ſet up a King of their own Royal Race.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Chief Miniſter, and Favourite, deſigning to mortifie the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> horribly charged that Country with Soldiers, and ſent thither the moſt licentious Troops to Quarter; imagining to chaſtiſe the Pride of this People in this manner, without any Form of Proceſs.</p>
                  <p>This Miniſter's Deſign has had ſo far its End, the Province being full of Diviſions and Slaughters, there wanting nothing to compleat their Miſeries. The Soldiers exerciſe unheard of Cruelties, they ſhed indifferently the Blood of Infants, Old Men, and Women; overthrowing Altars, and ruining Temples. The moſt couragious Peaſants gather together to repel Force with Force, and revenge themſelves moſt cruelly on as many of the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> as they can light of, without ſparing the King's Miniſters; killing all they meet, ſeeking thoſe who are hid, to puniſh them with the greateſt rigour, running after thoſe who ſeek their Safety by flight, not pardoning the very Prieſts, if never ſo little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>The Count of St. <hi>Colomme,</hi> commanded not long ſince in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> which poor Man is now before <hi>God,</hi> where he receives the Recompences or Chaſtiſements he has deſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Victim ſacrificed to the Peaſants Fury: His Bloud was the Prologue of a diſmal Tragedy, which will not end without more diſmal Events to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and the <hi>Catalonians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> withdrew himſelf into the Arſenal of <hi>Barcellona</hi> at the firſt Inſurrection of the Peaſants, where he was beſieged by a great Multitude of theſe Seditious People; and ſeeing he could not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46436:138"/>remain there in Safety, he went out to go on board the Gallies; but the Groſſneſs of his Body hindring him from haſtning as faſt as thoſe who accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in his Flight, he remained alone; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tired, fell into a Swoon, and lay dead for ſome time on the Sand between the Rocks which lie upon the Sea. His Servant, the only one that remained with him, brought him again to himſelf, by caſting the Sea-Water on his Face; but he opened his eyes, only to ſee his own Departure more nearly. He was ſet upon in this Condition, wherein he could not ſtir himſelf, by a crew of Blood-hounds, who firſt ſhot at him, and then hack'd him in pieces, having firſt ſtabb'd him in a thouſand places. His Servant defended him as well as he could, in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him with his Body, but his Zeal was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and all the Wounds he received, ſaved not one from his Maſter. He was an <hi>African,</hi> and had been his Slave. The Courage and Fidelity of a Man of ſo mean Birth, deſerves at leaſt, that it ſhould be ſaid of him, That he died in imitating the Vertues of thoſe Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> which are at this day praiſed and admired by all the World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Death ſtopt not the Peaſants; they proceeded to Exceſſes ſcarcely imaginable; and their Barbarity made them commit ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, together with ſuch ridiculous Actions, as can hardly be expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Wretches went to the Palace of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de Ville Franche,</hi> General of the Gallies; where having cut the Throats of as many as they met with, they burnt and battered all the Houſhold-Stuff, and carried in Proceſſion on the top of a Pike, a little Braſs-Figure, which they thought a black Angel; which Figure was only that of a Man, wherein a Clock was included, whoſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Springs made him move his Eyes; which Sight ſo ſurprized theſe Peaſants, who had never
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46436:138"/>ſeen or heard of ſuch a Machine, that they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſuch a Stupidity, as retarded for ſome time the Effects of their Fury. But there was one more bold than the reſt, who approaching to the Piece, cried out, 'Twas the Familiar Spirit of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de Ville Franche,</hi> and ought to be ſeized on, and thrown into Priſon, to take away its Power. Which he had no ſooner ſaid, but laid Hands on it, and tied and bound it faſt on the top of a Spear, and with great Shouts, walked it about the Town. The ignorant People, capable of any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous impreſſions, as well as the Women, who are not hard to be deluded, followed them, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the <hi>Marquiſs</hi>'s Devil was carried trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly along the Streets. Having ran through all the Town of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> this Rabble gave the Clock into the Hands of the Biſhop and Inquiſitors, to exorciſe it, and drive out the Devil, whom they thought capable of deſtroying their whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                  <p>Affairs are carried on more ſeriouſly in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and at a more moderate rate; the Inhabitants of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as well as the <hi>Nobility,</hi> have treated the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> with more Humanity: They immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected a King, who reigns peaceably, as Heir of the Crown, and thereby aſcertain'd of being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Affection and Fidelity of the People. There is already News of his Coronation; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of which was performed with great Pomp and Magnificence. The <hi>People,</hi> as a Mark of their Affection, have preſented a Million of Gold to their new Lord; the <hi>Clergy</hi> Sixty Thouſand Crowns; and the <hi>Nobility</hi> Four Hundred; and the new King has taken on him the Name of <hi>John</hi> IV, King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> inſtead of that of <hi>Don John,</hi> Duke <hi>de Braganza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never any Plot better ſucceeded: The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guezes</hi> have driven out from them a puiſſant and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46436:139"/>politick Nation without Bloud-ſhed, ſaving that of a Villain; but of that thou ſhalt hear more the next opportunity; for I ſhall carefully inform my ſelf of the Particulars of ſo extraordinary an Event, to give an exact Account to the <hi>Vizir.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, King <hi>Philip</hi> is the moſt unfortunate Prince that ever aſcended the Throne, committing his Affairs to the management of another; ſo that it may be ſaid, The Duke who reigns as Sovereign in <hi>Madrid,</hi> has choſen <hi>Philip</hi> IV. for his Favourite. The Miniſter commands, and the King obeys; the Maſter's Weakneſs, authorizes the Servant's Power; the Confuſion of that Nation being ſo great, that thoſe made by Heaven to receive Orders, are the only Perſons who give them.</p>

                  <p>TO what purpoſe doſt thou bewail the Ruins which the Fire has cauſed in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> if there be no Remedy for the Loſſes thou haſt ſuffered? Not all the <hi>Vizirs</hi> together, nor the Prince himſelf, whoſe Authority knows no Bounds, could reſiſt the Fury of this Element. What then can we do, Wretches as we are, liable to all Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Diſgraces? Art thou the firſt honeſt man that has been ruined? 'Tis true, Heaven had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched thee; thy Chambers were hung with the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46436:139"/>fineſt <hi>Perſian</hi> Tapeſtry; thou haſt a great number of Slaves, fine Gardens, and bathing-places, beſet with delicate Fountains; muſt thou deſpair for the Loſs of the greateſt part of theſe? Comfort thy ſelf, ſeeing thou art not in a Fault, nor haſt contributed to thine own Misfortune.</p>
                  <p>Thou telleſt me, that the burning of the chief City of the Univerſe, has deprived thee in one day of all the Commodities and Conveniences thou haſt laboured for many Years: And, I anſwer thee, That he which gave thee theſe Goods, expects Thanks from thee, in that having enriched thee with what thou had'ſt not, he did not take from thee thy Life at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>Haſt thou ſo ſoon forgotten <hi>Seneca's Demetrius?</hi> Haſt thou loſt any thing, which thou didſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Liberality of Fortune? And, if whatever thou hadſt was given thee, wherefore doſt thou afflict thy ſelf, as if thou couldſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain again as much?

                  <p>If thou liveſt, thou wilt ſee thy ſelf in the ſame Condition again; I cannot give thee a better Conſolation, I will not lament with thee, it ſeeming to me a fruitleſs thing. If thou beeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to forget the Loſſes thou haſt ſuffered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great Damages the ſame Fire has cauſed to ſo many <hi>Believers,</hi> in the ſame City where thou bewaileſt thy Misfortunes. How many People that had leſs than thee, have loſt more? And, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better People than thy ſelf, as more ſubmitting to the Will of Heaven, have ſuffered Miſeries infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than thine?</p>

                  <p>So great a Conflagration, wherein the Chief City of the World ſaw it ſelf near reduced to Aſhes, muſt needs have been a very diſmal spectacle. When I read the Relation which thou haſt made me, I tremble with Horror, to ſee ſo many magnificent Houſes, and ſtately <hi>Moſques</hi> devoured by the Flames, and reduced to nothing; with ſuch Riches, Goods, Houſl old-ſtuff, and ineſtimable. Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes, publick Regiſters, and choice Manuſcripts, whoſe Loſs can never be repaired, being become the Prey of this Element which devours all things. But thou and I are not the firſt, neither ſhall be the laſt, who bewail the Ruines of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. How many Towns in <hi>Aſia,</hi> how many in <hi>Greece,</hi> have been ſwallowed up in an inſtant by dreadful Earthquakes? And, how many Ruines are to be found in the famous Cities of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedonia?</hi> And, how many times have the Iſles of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Paphos,</hi> been entirely depopulated? We ſee not only the moſt ſolid Edifices periſh, which are the Works of Men, but even Mountains annihilated. There are whole Countries, which have (as it were) vaniſhed; the Sea has covered ſuch ſpaces of Land as might have made whole Provinces, and which were extream populous. How many Promontories do we ſee, which were heretofore certain Guides to Pilots, but are now buried in the Sand, and cauſe oftentimes Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks? And, if the Works of Nature be expoſed to ſuch great Ruines, what may not mortal Men expect to ſuffer? But, I ſpend time in relating or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Accidents, when I might remember thee of greater Ruines which the Fire made in the ſame Imperial City, after it had been built by the <hi>Great Conſtantine,</hi> to whom ſhe owed all her Splendor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mighty and Succeſsful Emperors of the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> had therein eſtabliſhed the Seat of their Empire.</p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:46436:140"/>
                  <p>Under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> if I be not miſtaken, the whole <hi>Continent</hi> lying along the <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> between both the Seas, was entirely ruined by Fire. And Twelve Years after, under the Reign of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the famous Library, ſo carefully collected, and with that extream Charge and Trouble, and which conſiſted of above Two hundred thouſand Manuſcripts: with the Skin of a Serpent 220 Foot long, whereon were written the entire Works of <hi>Homer,</hi> was conſumed. The Fire which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Time of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> might make one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get others; the famous Temple of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> which is at this day our chief <hi>Moſque,</hi> could not be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the fury of the Flames, being almoſt wholly conſumed by it. I ſhall not mention the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines which have happened by Earthquakes, under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Zeno Izoria.</hi> There was a far greater under <hi>Bajazet</hi> II. for, in <hi>Pruzia</hi> an entire City, with its Houſes, Walls, and Three Thouſand Inhabitants, were buried in the Entrails of the Earth: Which muſt convince us, there have been in all Ages ſuch Events, as may inſtruct us to bear our Misfortunes with Patience, and to believe a Providence, and ſubmit our ſelves wholly to it.</p>
                  <p>Let us (my dear Friend) for once rejoyce, in an Occaſion wherein all others mourn; in that we are able to perſuade our ſelves, <hi>There's nothing here below deſerves our Care.</hi> I do not ſay, we ſhould laugh like <hi>Nero,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Rome</hi> burning, which he himſelf had fired, and ſang the Paſſage in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> wherein the Conflagration of <hi>Troy</hi> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: Rather do as <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who having ſaved from the Flames, which devoured his Countrey and Eſtate, his <hi>Tutelar Gods,</hi> his Father <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> his Family and himſelf, became an <hi>Hero</hi> that ſerved for an Example to Poſterity. He did not ſpend his time in bewailing the Goods he had loſt, but always kept an undaunted Courage in the midſt of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46436:141"/>the Tempeſt which threatned to overwhelm him, as ſoon as he was on the Sea, and which forced him to wander from Port to Port, void of all Help, perſecuted by a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> and other <hi>Gods</hi> who were of her Party; and having gallantly endured ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſgraces, he became the Founder of the braveſt and famouſeſt nation of the Univerſe. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Gods and his Father, who were the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his Fortune, drew down the Graces of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which put an end to his Miſeries, in ſettling him in a Country, where he laid the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an Empire, which ſince has given Laws to all the World.</p>
                  <p>Our ſins have kindled the Fire at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the Debaucheries, Impieties, Hypocriſies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Rapins which remain unpuniſhed, are the Cauſes of the Deſtruction of the famous City of the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>Can we imagine, when <hi>God</hi> ſends his Judgements down upon us, that we can be able to reſiſt them? Amend thy Life, if thou deſireſt to be revenged of Fortune, and be Proof againſt all her Darts. Encreaſe in Vertue, if thou wouldeſt be invulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; be as good in Proſperity as in Adverſity. Nothing but good Works can make thee happy in this World, and live when this World ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p>If Reaſon cannot ſtop our Tears, Fortune I am ſure will never do it. We ſeem herein very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for, when we firſt ſee the Light, we weep; and when we leave it, we groan.</p>
                  <p>Live ever with me more nearly than an intimate Friend, and imitate (if a man may ſo expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) the Fire, which (according to what appears to us) conſumes all things, and converts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own proper Subſtance; but which yet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules preſcribed by its Creator, burns not the Air, nor the other Elements; but keeps
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46436:141"/>them united, warms and conſerves them. <hi>God</hi> has endued them with an Inſtinct which ought to do the ſame thing; he has faſtned them one to another, with ſuch Bonds as nothing can break; I mean the Intereſt, and mutual Needs which they have of one another. There being no body that can be happy, and become Rich of himſelf; there muſt he Dependencies and Commerce, without which 'tis impoſſible to have that is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. There is alſo a more refined Commerce, to wit, the Marks of Eſteem which men give one another; Succors in caſes of Need, whether of Money or good Counſel; the latter of which, is all that can be expected from thy faithful <hi>Mahmut.</hi>

                  <p>THe Veſſels of <hi>Africk</hi> have again been worſted by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> the Particulars of which muſt needs be known to thee before they could come here, where there is much Diſcourſe of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at <hi>Goulette,</hi> and the Battel of <hi>Caraoge,</hi> to the great Diſadvantage and Prejudice of the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Name. Theſe Heatheniſh People, make publick Rejoicings for the Victories obtained by another Nation. 'Tis ſaid, that of Five Gallies, and three other great Veſſels, onely one Ship ſaved it ſelf by Flight; ſeveral being ſunk to the Bottom, together with the Admiral of <hi>Caraoge,</hi> the reſt having been brought into <hi>Malta;</hi> and that there were Six Hundred <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> kill'd; in whoſe
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46436:142"/>Death, our only Conſolation is, that they died Martyrs, and their Bloud will cry for Vengeance againſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> that have ſhed it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis hard to find the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi> in the Chart, and yet harder in the Sea; it being a meer Atom of inviſible Earth: But, 'tis not ſo with the <hi>Knights,</hi> who are the Maſters of it, they being a Hundred, often ſeen and felt by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Malta</hi> is a Seminary, wherein are brought up the braveſt Sparks in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> pick'd out from amongſt the moſt Illuſtrious Families.

                     <hi>To the Invincible</hi> Vizir Azem.</head>
                  <p>AN Illuſtrious Woman of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> governed not long ſince in <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the Name of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Her Name is <hi>Margarita,</hi> and commonly reſides at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but this Princeſs, with the Title of <hi>Vice-Queen,</hi> had not the Credit or Authority neceſſary to ſuſtain the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; though ſhe had otherwiſe all the Prudence, and Courage requiſite thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Vaſconcelli,</hi> her chief Secretary, having uſurped all the Authority, carried all things with a high Hand; to which he added a moſt griping Covetouſneſs, which was no leſs diſadvantageous to his Miſtreſs's Reputatior. And, the Marquis <hi>de la Puebla,</hi> a <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Miniſter, an Accomplice of <hi>Vaſconcelii,</hi> had eſtabliſhed himſelf in this Court, as a rigid Cenſurer of all the <hi>Vice-Queen's</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call theſe Two Men Two Pedants, ſet over the Princeſs, as if ſhe had been ſtill in her Minority, to correct and regulate her Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The too great Authority of theſe Two Miniſters, became at length a kind of Tyranny. The <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> complained for the loſs of their Privileges, and the <hi>People</hi> at their being oppreſs'd with Taxes; which made the Miniſtry of <hi>Vaſconcelli</hi> ſeem inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46436:143"/>in which 'was ſeen the <hi>Vice-Queen</hi> had no part. This Princeſs not having the Power to ſtop the courſe of the Miſchiefs which began to ſpring up, gave Advice of it to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and expected thence the Remedy: But, whether the King was not in a Condition to give any, or his Miniſters concealed from him the ſtate of things; the Miſchiefs encreaſed, and <hi>Vaſconcelli</hi>'s Friends, by excuſing him, made it almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid them.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Margarita</hi> repreſented the Danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Portugal</hi> lay, ſhe was heard as a weak and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Woman, and was often accuſed of being over timerous; which cauſed a general Revolt in this Kingdom, which was few days in contriving, and as few hours in executing.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt hear thy humble Slave, I'll relate to thee all the Circumſtances, of ſo great an Event; which will ſeem a Fable, ſhould we refer our ſelves to only Reaſon; but which however is a real Hiſtory, as is now well known throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Never was there a greater Hatred between Two Nations, than that which was between the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and the <hi>Portugueſes:</hi> And, though they had one and the ſame Religion, and almoſt the ſame Humour; yet 'tis not to be imagined, how far their mutual Averſions carryed them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have a common Proverb, which ſays, That a Man is obliged to treat and love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man as his Brother, whether he be a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> or a <hi>Moor,</hi> without excepting the moſt Barbarous of Mankind; <hi>yea, though he were a</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</p>
                  <p>They have lived with great Patience, under the Domination of <hi>Philip</hi> II. and his Succeſſors, (ſince the Death of their King <hi>D. Sebaſtian,</hi> who was kill'd in <hi>Africa</hi> in a Battel againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi>) whilſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46436:143"/>they were ſuffered to enjoy the Privileges which were granted them. Moreover, they ſtill expected the Return of their Sovereign; who was ſaid not to have dyed in the Field, but having long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred about in ſtrange Countries, was in fine about to return. But the Example of the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> made them at length reſolve upon what they now execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Nobility</hi> were the firſt that began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, and paſt over thoſe Bounds, which Reſpect does ordinarily place between the Sovereign and his Subjects. They alledged ſeveral Pretences for their Rebellion; but the moſt ſpecious was, their unwillingneſs to be ſacrificed in unjuſt Wars, vvherein the moſt dangerous Poſts vvere committed to them, as they ſeveral times reproached the Duke, Favourite and Miniſter of King <hi>Philip</hi> IV.</p>
                  <p>They immediately carryed on their Intelligences vvith great Secrecy; and vvhen they came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves, the greateſt Perſons conſented to the Conſpiracy, and the boldeſt amongſt them have executed it vvith great Valour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dom Juan,</hi> Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> is the greateſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-Man in this Kingdom, and perhaps in all <hi>Spain,</hi> and already of the Age vvherein men are vvont to have Wiſdom, together vvith Strength of Body. He vvants not for Ingenuity and Svveetneſs of Temper. He received the Crovvn, after long preſſings and refuſals; and indeed, is the more vvorthy of it, as being the lawful Heir to it.</p>
                  <p>The Favourite Duke, was well enough informed of the Reputation and Authority of the Duke of <hi>Braganza;</hi> and conſidering him as a Prince who might lawfully pretend to the Crown, he made uſe of ſeveral Artifices to drive him out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> or ſeize him Priſoner. But having always tryed this in vain, whether by reaſon of the extraordinary watchfulneſs of <hi>Dom Juan,</hi> or that the Heavens, on which depend the things here below, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46436:144"/>ordered it, 'twas impoſſible for this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to get ſo good a Prey into his Hands.</p>
                  <p>This crafty Miniſter has tryed all Ways, and ſometimes made uſe of the Fox's Skin, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles of the Lyon's Voice, to bring about his Ends. Sometimes he tryed to draw him to Court, offering him the moſt honourable Employs there, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to accompany the <hi>Catholick</hi> King in his Voyage into <hi>Catalonia.</hi> But, the Duke knew how to defend himſelf againſt the Snare, and timely withdrew to <hi>Villa Vicioſa,</hi> the ordinary place of his Abode, and whence he excuſed himſelf from going to <hi>Madrid;</hi> ſometimes, for that he had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bear his Charges according to his Quality in ſuch a Journey; and otherwhiles, on other Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with which the Favourite Duke was obliged to ſeem contented. Though he was not, yet he feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf to be ſatisfied, to put in practice the moſt exquiſite piece of Policy he ever made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>He ſent him Forty Thouſand Piſtols, to buy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and at the ſame time ſent him alſo the General Command of the Troops in <hi>Portugal;</hi> with Order to come to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and as <hi>High-Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the Kingdom, to obſerve the Motions of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> which threatned <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> with a powerfull Fleet. But he had ſent the following Order to <hi>D. Lopes d' Oſſio: Thou haſt the Command of the Naval Army, get immediately before</hi> Lisbon. Dom Juan de Braganza <hi>has Orders to viſit the Veſſels; as ſoon as he ſhall enter the firſt Gally, clap him in Irons, and immediately depart with this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to</hi> Cadis, <hi>where I have appointed People to convey him to</hi> Madrid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dom Lopes</hi> could not execute his Commiſſion; his Army was loſt on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas, and 'twas written in Heaven, That <hi>Dom Juan</hi> ſhould live, and be a King. This Artifice having fail'd, the Duke had recourſe to another; which was to ſend an
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:46436:144"/>Order to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to viſit all the Forts on the Frontiers; where there were ſtrict Injunctions, to detain him. But, he perceiving the Project of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter, knew ſo well to excuſe himſelf from undertaking this Buſineſs, that he made the Deſigns of his Enemy to vaniſh this time alſo, and got leave to retire to <hi>Villa Vicioſa.</hi> Thoſe who penetrated not the Artifices of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> were aſtoniſht at the Accumulation of ſo many Favours and Honours on the Perſon of the Duke, affirming, the Court had Intentions of raiſing him to the Throne, or bringing him to the Scaffold; in which laſt they were not miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olivarez,</hi> who let ſlip no Occaſion of laying Snares for <hi>Braganza,</hi> grew the more obſtinate by the Difficulties he met with. He ſent him a new Order to raiſe Troops, and to lead them himſelf into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> for the Chaſtiſement of the Rebels; this being of abſolute Neceſſity, ſaid he in his Letters, for the upholding of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, to which the Revolt of this Province cauſed great Miſchiefs.</p>
                  <p>The Duke obeyed in part; he raiſed a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of Troops, at his own Charge; but he took care of his own Perſon. He wrote to the Court to excuſe him from that Voyage, and added to his excuſes moſt earneſt Prayers; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, That being ſick of the World, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into his own Eſtate, to lead there a quiet Life, free from the Vexations of Buſineſs; which obliged him to entreat his <hi>Catholick</hi> Majeſty, to grant him that Reſt, which was the only thing he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The Duke <hi>de Braganza</hi>'s Letter drew no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter; but his Deſigns were diſcovered, and the <hi>Nobility</hi> foreſeeing how likely they were to be brought under a more ſtrict Subjection, began to murmur, ſaying, 'Twas their Duty to rid themſelves of thoſe Oppreſſors, who
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46436:145"/>had ſo long peeled them, and ſet up a New Form of Government. The <hi>Poor,</hi> who ſuffered moſt by the Taxes, were the boldeſt, and encouraged the reſt. Some were for ſetting up an <hi>Elective</hi> King, others propoſed the raiſing to this Honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Braganza,</hi> who alone ſeemed worthy of it. Some there were, who were for putting themſelves under the Domination of <hi>France;</hi> and other perſons of Credit amongſt the People, were for a <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Government; and others again, were for turning the Kingdom into a <hi>Republick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nobility</hi> were in great Perplexity in the Choice they ſhould make; for 'twas not known whether the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> would receive the Crown, in caſe twas offered him again; for the moſt qualified Perſons of the Kingdom had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to him.</p>
                  <p>There was none but <hi>D. Gaſton Cattique,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as Eloquent as Stout, whom Heaven deſign'd for the perſuading of this Prince, that could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. He pretended to fight a Duel with a Nephew he had; whom having ſlightly wounded, he left <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as a man that had brought himſelf into danger; and wandring about from thence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, as it were, of the place of Retreat he would chuſe, he went at length to <hi>Villa-Vicioſa;</hi> where having found <hi>Braganza</hi> in his Solitude, he thus ſpake to him:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I bring this day a Crown, which the</hi> Nobility <hi>of</hi> Portugal <hi>preſents thee; and if thou haſt the Courage to receive it, we are ready to put it on thine Head. This Kingdom belongs to thee as the undoubted Heir of our Natural and Lawful Princes. If thou accepteſt of the Crown, the Kingdom juſtly belongs to thee; and if thou dareſt not receive it, we will chooſe another Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, of greater Reſolution, and who is willing to command us. The Scepter ſhakes in King</hi> Philip<hi>'s Hand, by reaſon of the Wars made againſt him from all parts. Conſider, if thou receiveſt not at preſent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46436:145"/>what Fortune preſents thee, thou wilt be obliged againſt thy Will to obey another: Neither the</hi> Nobility, <hi>the</hi> Clergy, <hi>nor the</hi> People <hi>will any longer ſuffer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of the</hi> Caſtilians. <hi>It belongs to thee at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to declare, whether thou wilt reign, and be a happy Prince. All the faithfull</hi> Portugueſes <hi>breath after thee, and deſire thee for their Soveraign. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to accept of what is ſo advantageous, and let us alone for the executing of our parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dom Juan</hi> anſwered coldly, to ſuch a bold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; more affrighted at the Peril there was in ſuch an Enterprize, than flattered with the Hopes of poſſeſſing a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But, in another Conference, wherein the Duke was told, the Conſpirators were reſolved to raiſe on the Throne another King, if he came not to a ſpeedy Reſolution: the Dutcheſs his Wife, who has a Man's Heart, and is more courageous than her Husband, coming into the Converſation thus ſpake to him with great Aſſurance:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord, the</hi> Catholick <hi>King has ſent for thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to Court; at</hi> Madrid <hi>thou wilt certainly meet with thy Death, and in receiving the Crown which is offered thee, thou art ſtill in danger of it: but if thou muſt periſh, which way ſoever thou turneſt thy ſelf, is it not more honourable to dye a King in thine own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than to dye with Chains in a Priſon by the hands of thine Enemy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So courageous a Diſcourſe brought <hi>Dom Juan</hi> to a Reſolution; wherefore he ſent Word to the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> of his Readineſs to comply with them.</p>
                  <p>The Conſpirators were ready at the hour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the Execution of their Deſign. Being well armed, and each of them accompanied with a good Number of Young Men, who were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, although they knew not the Deſign. As ſoon as ever the Signal was given, they all ſet forth from the Places where they were aſſembled;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46436:146"/>and thoſe that were fartheſt diſtant, joined the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and all together ſoon poſſeſſed themſelves of the Palace of the <hi>Vice-Queen;</hi> they immediately made themſelves Maſters of the Guard, finding no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, and this without ſpilling a Drop of Bloud, or doing any Violence. They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cryed out altogether, <hi>Long live the new King,</hi> D. Juan de Braganza, <hi>and let them dye that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern ill.</hi> They ſiezed on the <hi>Vice-Queen,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to retire into an Apartment, where ſhe ſhould be treated with the Reſpect due to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but not obeyed as having Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaſconcelli,</hi> who knew himſelf faulty, and to whom his Conſcience reproached his Crimes, in this moment hid himſelf in a great Preſs, under an heap of Papers; where, having been diſcovered by an old Woman, he had immediately his Throat cut, and his Body thrown out at a Window; where he ſerved for ſome time a <hi>May-game</hi> to the People, who left not one part of his Body free from ſome Mark of their Indignation.</p>
                  <p>One of this Miniſter's Domeſticks, threw himſelf out at the ſame Window his Maſter was thrown; not in a deſign of following his Fate, but of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf; and he dyed without its being known, whether 'twas by his Fall, or the Musket-ſhot which he received.</p>
                  <p>The Confederates, with as little trouble, ſeized on the Gallies and other Veſſels in the Ports, whence they drove the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> they afterwards comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Vice-Queen</hi> to retire. This Princeſs thought ſhe ought in this occaſion, to inſiſt on the Greatneſs of her Birth; ſhe threatned the Conſpirators, and afterwards flattered them, aſſuring them of the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of King <hi>Philip.</hi> She ſet before them the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power, and forgat not to ſpeak of the Authority of his Favourite, who muſt needs be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46436:146"/>much offended in this Occaſion; exaggerating the Offence commitred againſt her, both as a Princeſs, and Depoſitory of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King's Power. But, as well her Promiſes as her Threats were in vain; and ſhe her ſelf was at length glad to accept Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them, who a while before, by Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance from the Prince, might have executed an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power.</p>
                  <p>In Eight days time, all the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, or driven out of the Kingdom. All the Forts were rendered, without any trouble, to the new King, except the Caſtle of St. <hi>John;</hi> which having made ſome ſlight Reſiſtance, was ſold for Forty Thouſand Crowns by the Governour.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> appeared immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where the People ſoon ſhewed the Affection they had for him; the Priſon-Doors were ſet open, and all poor Debtors freed, and a great part of the Taxes taken off. Such an aſtoniſhing Succeſs, was attended with what ever might ſet forth the Joy of the People, who ſolemnized the Feſtival with the Sound of Trumpets, and the Noiſe of the Cannon, and by Shouts and Acclamations, which reached up to Heaven, whom the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> thanked for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they believed they had recovered. This Event was accompanied with ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous things, that the Wiſeſt as well as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, were perſuaded, 'twas markt in Heaven from all Eternity by the Finger of God. The <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> the <hi>Citizens</hi> and <hi>Peaſants,</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in their Liberalities on this Occaſion, to give their new Soveraign ample Marks of their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and even the <hi>Poor</hi> hid their Miſery, that they might not leſſen the Publick Joy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels which returned from the <hi>New World,</hi> which then entered into the Ports of <hi>Portugal,</hi> remained at the Diſpoſal of the new
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46436:147"/>King, the Pilots not knowing what had hapned; ſo that the Coffers of the Prince were filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as 'tis ſaid) with ſome Millions.</p>
                  <p>This King was exalted to the Throne in the laſt Moon of the laſt Year; and wiſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do hope he will reign very happily, all the Planets being too well diſpoſed, not to make him finiſh his Reign with the ſame Fortune as he began it.</p>
                  <p>The vigilant <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> have ordered out ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Veſſels, fill'd with good Soldiers, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proviſions, to ſieze of Places and Ports, which this Nation poſſeſſes in the <hi>New World,</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> and 'tis to be ſuppoſed, they will meet with good Succeſs, if Fortune prove as favourable to them in <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> as ſhe was to them in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was proclaim'd King, he ſent <hi>Manifeſto's</hi> into all Parts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Couriers and Ambaſſadors, to give Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Promotion in the Courts of <hi>France, England, Holland, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> 'Tis not to be imagined the Joy which this Adventure gave to the <hi>Catalonians.</hi> The King imparting to them what had happened, offered them alſo his Aſſiſtance; and theſe People anſwered him with the ſame Offers. And this is the end of Sixty Three Years of the <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Authority, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have exerciſed on the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The News of ſo ſtrange a Revolution having been carried unto <hi>Madrid,</hi> hear, and conſider well the unhappy Condition of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, to whom his Favourite declared this News.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>I come to rejoyce with your Majeſty at the good News I bring. Your Majeſty is now become Maſter of a conſiderable Dutchy.</hi> Dom Juan de Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza, <hi>has had the boldneſs to make himſelf be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of</hi> Portugal; <hi>has thereby faln into the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46436:147"/>Crime of</hi> Laeſae Majeſtatis; <hi>All his Eſtate belongs to you, and is devolv'd to the Crown, and his Perſon will ſoon be in your Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dom Juan</hi> was Son to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi> Grandchild to <hi>Donna Katharina,</hi> who was the Daughter of <hi>Dom Duarte,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> took away the Crown from this <hi>Katharine,</hi> to whom it is ſaid it did rightly belong.</p>
                  <p>The Titles he aſſumes are, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of <hi>Algraves, Africk</hi> on both ſides of the Sea, Lord of <hi>Guinea,</hi> of the Navigation and Commerce of <hi>Aethiopia, Arabia, Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This new King is not above 37 Years Old; of a middle Stature, but well proportioned; his Face marked with the Small Pox, his Hair enclining to Yellow, an Aquiline Noſe, high Forehead, lively Eyes, his Mouth indifferent great, and a Maſculine Voice. His Carriage is grave, affects great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty in his Cloaths, is temperate in his Dyet, affable to all ſorts of People, unleſs Slaves, and ſuch as he believes are Hypocrites, and his common Word is, <hi>That mean Cloaths will keep out the Cold, and ordinary Meats ſatisfie Hunger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Prince is not much verſed in Books, is of an healthfull Conſtitution, loves laborious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, eſpecially Hunting, wherein he's never tired. He's alſo Muſically given, and ſo light of Heel, that there are few People can out-walk him. He is wont to go to Bed late, and riſe early, as knowing that Sleep does take off much from Man's Life; and to compleat his Happineſs, he has Children of both Sexes. His Wife is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Merit, to whoſe marvellous Courage and good Qualities he owes his Crown.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> contains 120 Leagues in Length, 40 in Breadth, and has ſeveral Millions of Subjects, comprehending thoſe in the Two
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46436:148"/>
                     <hi>Indies.</hi> It has Three <hi>Archbiſhopricks,</hi> and Eight <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> keeping ordinarily Forty Veſſels, which find Ports in Eight places of the Country. They can maintain Thirty Thouſand Foot, and ſeveral Regiments of Horſe. The Revenue of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may amount to Twenty Millions of Gold, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning in the Riches which come from the <hi>Indies Braſil, Angola,</hi> and ſeveral other Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Monarch, will hold a good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the Houſe of <hi>Braganza. England</hi> will enter into an Alliance with her; the <hi>Pope</hi> will concern himſelf on neither ſide; the Emperour united by Bloud and Intereſt to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> will be an irreconcilable Enemy, but unable to doe them any Hurt; and, the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> will find greater Advantage than all others in this ſtrange Revolution. Theſe are the Sentiments of thoſe that pretend to penetrate into the Future, and to know more than others. And if it be true, that this new Soveraign has had, as all men in his place would have had, a ſecret deſire of being King; he has ſo well concealed his Ambition, that 'tis to be ſuppoſed he will prove a moſt Judicious Prince, that will uphold his Authority more by his Wiſdom and Prudence, than by Force. The Juſt <hi>God</hi> cut ſhort the Courſe of his ill Deſigns, ſhould he have the Courage and Deſire of reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one Day the Death of his Predeceſſor, <hi>Dom Sebaſtian,</hi> on the Faithfull <hi>Muſſulmen</hi> of <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt find, invincible <hi>Vizier,</hi> the faithful and reſpectful <hi>Mahmut</hi> always ready to execute the Orders which thou ſhalt ſend him for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ror's Service; and ready to obey the leaſt Signs of thy Victorious Hand, to Death, whether Natural or Violent.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Enguril Emir Mehemet Cheik, <hi>a man of the Law.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TEll me this once, whether thou beeſt alive, and at Liberty; and whether thou doſt real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love me, or onely pretend it. My Friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no anſwers to my Letters, which makes me ſtrangely ignorant of all things; I know onely by Conjecture, that which is never ſo little doubtful; and that which is certain, cannot be known here truly as it falls out, as being related according to peoples Paſſions and Intereſts. There's no body dares write to me freely what he thinks; and there are few that will inform me of what is come to their knowledge, left their Letters ſhould be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>I know very well we have a new Maſter, but I know not whether he be thought a more able Prince than <hi>Amurath,</hi> and has the ſame Courage and Fancy for War. The <hi>Chiaus</hi> that lately arrived in this Court of <hi>France,</hi> is very reſerved to me, and makes a Myſtery of every thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Armurath</hi> is dead; thoſe who ſay he was Cruel, yet declare him to be the moſt dexterous, Valiant and Compleateſt Man in his Empire. The <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are Fools, who will not hence gather, That our Monarchs moſt certain Maxim, to reign with Authority and perfect Security, is, <hi>To make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be feared, and not to be ſhy of ſpilling the Bloud of thoſe who ſerve them ill; who are ſuſpected by them, or may prove troubleſome to them.</hi> Thoſe Troops of <hi>Mutes,</hi> which abide always in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obey the leaſt Sign of thoſe who give them Orders; maintain, encreaſe and render Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46436:149"/>the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power: For, the Empire would never be at Peace, but in continual Trouble, ſhould all the Sons and Nephews of our <hi>Sultans</hi> be ſuffered to live: and we ſhould have a whole Nation of Princes who would be always a biting, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ruining one another by Civil Wars, as is often ſeen to happen amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Whence this certain Maxim is practiſed, <hi>That it is better it ſhould coſt innocent perſons their Lives, than ot to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe who may be Faulty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, I muſt confeſs I knew not, that <hi>Amurath</hi> himſelf kill'd, with his own Hands, his own Siſter. Thou that knoweſt the ſecret of this Tragedy, canſt tell whether he was tranſported to that Exceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe anſwered with great Haughtineſs to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her Mother, who reprehended her on ſome Secret Love ſhe entertained: If this be the caſe, ſhe dyed not innocent, and I have a great Curioſity to know the Particulars of it.</p>
                  <p>But do not relate to me the unhappy end of his Two Brothers, <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Orcan,</hi> leſt thou make an old Wound bleed afreſh. Poor Princes, what Crime have they committed, if their Brother reigns? Cruel King! how great was thy Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſeeing they obeyed without murmuring?</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Amurath</hi> was a dreadful Lover, who tamed his Paſſions with a Poignard; he ſtabb'd the moſt beautiful of his <hi>Sultaneſſes;</hi> and for what Reaſon? The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> pardon him the Bloud of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which he ſpilt of his Siſter, and of the brave <hi>Fracardin,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Viſirs</hi> of his Friends, and ſo many brave Commanders, and illuſtrious Perſons; but they will not pardon him the Death of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs: for, they cannot conceive how a Prince, a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> can play the Hangman, in ſuch a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious place, where he has nothing to do, but to think of giving his Love agreeable Marks of his Paſſion. But, you will tell me perhaps ſhe was ſo
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46436:149"/>bold as to wear in his Sight, Flowers and Perfumes which came from his Brother: It is certainly a great Crime, not to obey thoſe who have all power to command us; but 'tis a greater Crime to lay on Commands, to have an occaſion for Cruelty. They ſay, a man which does ſuch an Action, is a Monſter; but I do not ſay ſo.</p>
                  <p>Inform me, what the new <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> does, of his Humour and Inclination. It appears, he is ſtill infirm, and ſtupified with his long Impriſonment. What Alterations has his Entrance into the Empire produced? Will he be Sanguinary, as his Brother was, or gracious and merciful?</p>
                  <p>Speak to me once, my dear Friend, with all Freedom, void of Diſguiſe; Is he amorouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd? I much value ſuch Princes, for they are generally mild; and this Paſſion ſoftens them, how cruel ſoever they may be; makes them libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Strangers to Covetouſneſs, that cruel Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which clouds and ſullies the brighteſt Vertues. How many perſons are employed to chooſe fine Women for the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to contribute to <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Pleaſure? Happy will the handſomeſt Woman of <hi>Aſia</hi> be. But the Eyes of this Monarch will be made like other mens, which are not allways allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the greateſt Beauties. Hence it is, That we have ſeen in our Emperor's <hi>Seraglio,</hi> Ladies which ſurpaſſed in Charms all others, and yet dyed Virgins, and neglected by them to whoſe Pleaſures they were conſecrated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chiaus</hi> has onely inform'd me, that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> appears often on Horſeback in the City, and ſeems a juſt and merciful Prince, and deſigns to make the Shepherd <hi>Haſſein,</hi> Prime <hi>Vizir;</hi> he that was ſo long the Companion of his Priſon. 'Tis ſaid, he often made it his Employment to divert <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> in his Confinement, by playing on his Pipe, and making him Diſcourſes without Art and extream
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46436:150"/>innocent, of what he did when he kept Sheep. He told me alſo, that he often went for his Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> to take the Air, and enjoy that Liberty of which he was lo long deprived; That he's alſo much delighted with the reading of <hi>Greek</hi> Books, eſpecially <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch;</hi> That he's very devout, though not ſuperſtitious, according to the Humour of the <hi>Devotees</hi> of our Law, who will have our Soveraigns be implacable Enemies to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> If this be neceſſary to Salvation, to perſecute a Religion contrary to Ours, what will become of all thoſe who are dead and never did it? I am of Opinion, <hi>That true Holineſs, conſiſts in doing Good, and living in Charity with all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infidels,</hi> with whom I live at preſent, for the Emperor's Service, whoſe Subject I am, do glory in their ſtrict Obſervance of this Precept which is in their Religion, and they are happy if they keep it. But tell me, Doſt thou think our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is like to have Children, as is already repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that he cannot live long? They are not only the idle People that talk at this rate, but thoſe whoſe Intereſt obliges them to know, who is to be the Succeſſor; and many of the ſolideſt think, it will be the King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and that thoſe of the Race of <hi>Mula Honkiar</hi> will be excluded.</p>
                  <p>This Race is really Illuſtrious, but every body knows not the Riſe of it. The Head of this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſcends from <hi>Tamerlane;</hi> thou knoweſt the reſt, and I will not diſpute with thee about Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogies.</p>
                  <p>Whatever paſſes here below is ſo uncertain, that thou maiſt accuſe me of Imprudence in diſcourſing of things at this diſtance; for, in Effect, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> may be a Father by this time. Pray to <hi>God,</hi> who diſpoſes of Thrones, makes Races endure, or decay; merit from him, by Faſtings and Prayers, and beg of him, that he would give me the Grace
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46436:150"/>to live blameleſs, and die innocent; that I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with thee into Heaven, and there enjoy thoſe unſpeakable good things, which are reſerved for the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>Love me, though diſtant from thee; and let me have Tokens of thy Friendſhip, by ſtealing ſome Moments of Leiſure from thy ordinary Buſineſs to write to me.</p>

He interprets all the Doubts which ariſe in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he's the Arbiter of Rewards and Puniſhments: and the King, who knows his Zeal and Ability, leaves to him the Direction of his Kingdom and People, which he governs and leads as <hi>Jacob</hi> led the Flocks of <hi>Laban.</hi> This <hi>Cardinal</hi> wants only the Art, which this great <hi>Patriarch</hi> had, to make Men be born as he pleaſed, as this Holy <hi>Iſraelite</hi> made the Sheep.</p>

                  <p>Some ſay, he has taken an unwiſe Courſe; and others ſay no; becauſe he could not prudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf of the Teſtimony of ſuch Wretches, who would not matter what they ſaid.</p>
                  <p>However, theſe Hermits were publickly executed, and their Accomplices are not yet diſcovered; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it yet known whether any perſons of Quality have had a part in the Conſpiracy; which is not the firſt that has been carried on againſt this Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and it is believed will not be the laſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lius Mazarin,</hi> a Man about 45 Years of Age, of a ſolid Judgment, and incredible Perſpicacity; of whoſe Family I know no more, but that he is originally from <hi>Sicily,</hi> and born in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the chief City of it, <hi>Rome;</hi> is lately introduced into this <hi>Court.</hi> He has by his ingenious Carriage, gained the Favour and Confidence of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu;</hi> and he begins already to be employed in the moſt important Buſineſs. Thoſe who make Reflexions on the Affairs of the World, and carefully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the extraordinary Talents of this <hi>Italian,</hi> are perſuaded one may expect great things from him; yet however, the beſt way is not to be haſty in judging of the good or bad Qualities of a Man. He has already been employed in Quality of Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary for the King of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to negotiate an Accommodation between all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And he has laboured ſo fortunately, that every body is aſtoniſh'd, that his firſt Undertakings ſhould meet with ſuch happy Succeſs; eſpecially conſidering the Hatreds and Pretenſions between the Ducheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and her Brothers-in-law. Thou maiſt remember that I wrote to thee, that the Differences of this <hi>Family</hi> were like to laſt, and unlikely to be determined without great Bloud-ſhed, both of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who is a moſt expert Courtier, and dexterous <hi>Agitant,</hi> has ended this Affair, much to his Maſter's Honour to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Parties intereſſed, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> who procured him this Commiſſion. He eſtabliſhed the Peace in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and an Union betwixt the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46436:154"/>Parties, by bringing over to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt Two Men who were Enemies to it; who were, Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> a Captain of great Reputation, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> his Brother, a Perſon of a conſummate Policy, and an excellent Soldier, though a Church-man.</p>
                  <p>It is mentioned in the Treaty, That theſe Two Princes ſhall be receiv'd into the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Protection: That if the young Duke dies without Children, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> marries, his Children ſhall be the Heirs of the Eſtates of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in defect of thoſe, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>'Tis moreover declared in the ſame Treaty, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall be ſought to, touching the Liberty of the Wiſe and Children of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who are detained Priſoners at <hi>Madrid:</hi> And he ſhall be alſo ſollicited, to ſurrender the places he holds belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And in caſe the <hi>Catholick</hi> King ſhall not reſtore them, and ſet at Liberty the Wife and Children of this Prince, he ſhall be obliged to ſerve againſt the ſaid King in the Army of <hi>France.</hi> 'Tis moreover inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt theſe Articles, That the moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King ſhall procure a Marriage to be made between one of the Children of the ſaid Prince, with the Duke of <hi>Longuevil</hi>'s Daughter, who is a rich Heireſs; and that <hi>France</hi> ſhall never make any Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> without comprehending the Liberty of the <hi>Princeſs,</hi> and the foreſaid <hi>Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> is now expected here; and it is ſaid, he will command the Army of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> it being certain, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſtore what they have once taken, neither will they ſet their Priſoners at liberty.</p>
                  <p>The King entertaining himſelf ſome days paſt, with the Ambaſſador of a Foreign <hi>Prince,</hi> ſaid to him theſe Words: <hi>When the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſhall reſtore to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>the Places they keep from
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46436:154"/>him, I ſhall willingly diſcharge my ſelf of the Burthen of the Government of thoſe I keep.</hi> And the <hi>Cardinal</hi> has publickly expreſs'd himſelf to this purpoſe: That <hi>his Maſter's Deſign was only to humble the Pride of the</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>and reduce it to ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that its Neighbours might have no ſuch great cauſe of fear from them; ſeeing the leaſt Motion of theirs, raiſed Alarms among them: That his Endeavours were not laid out in aggrandizing the Dominion of</hi> France, <hi>ſeeing the Bounds of it were large enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; his Intentions being only to give his Sovereign the laſt Proof of his Zeal and Affection, by leaving the Kingdom in a profound Peace, which might make his Majeſty beloved of his Neighbours, and feared by thoſe who are jealous of his Greatneſs and Power; he being hereby the Arbiter of</hi> Europe, <hi>and reigning more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by this means, than if all the Eſtates belonged unto him.</hi> What I have written to thee, happened ſome time ſince; but what I am now to inform thee of, is quite new.</p>
                  <p>We have an Account, That the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have not kept their Word with the King, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and <hi>Mazarin;</hi> and Deſigns are now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in hand, to puniſh ſo great an Affront; and theſe are buſied, in thoughts of revenging a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-Princeſs, who has been ſo long forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold bloudy Tragedies in her Houſe, by the Wars which the Princes of the Blood make continually; wherein Strangers do intereſt themſelves, who ruine the Eſtates, and keep them up in perpetual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>This Buſineſs will cauſe new Troubles in <hi>Italy,</hi> and thou ſhalt therefore not fail of Intelligence of the Particulars. However, the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> are blamed by all the World, and charged with want of Sincerity. But, this being almoſt a Rule amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians, To obſerve their Word no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they find their Advantage in it;</hi> thou needeſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46436:155"/>not therefore much wonder at what theſe <hi>Princes</hi> have done: Whereby thou wilt know, That a mean Intereſt being the Motive that ſets them at work, and which is all their Reaſon of State; he that will one day equally judge all the World, and can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all the Univerſe in leſs time than he created it, will deſtroy the little Powers of theſe weak Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who acknowledge the Law of the <hi>Nazarite,</hi> to the immortal Glory of the Venerable and Holy Name of the faithful <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>

                  <p>I Muſt forget my ſelf, if I forget thee; but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often on my ſelf, I cannot forget thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art my ſecond ſelf.

                  <p>I am endeavouring to procure thee the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Invincible <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my Deſign; and this is the beſt manner I could deviſe of doing it. Thou ſhalt pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from ſome Friend which thou ſhalt leave at <hi>Palermo,</hi> the Memoirs which I ſend thee with this Letter; and it will not be difficult to make it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, thou holdeſt a Correſpondence in this Town of <hi>Sicily,</hi> conſidering the time we have lived there together, during our Slavery.</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:46436:155"/>
                  <p>The Auguſt <hi>Vizir,</hi> who rules and governs the Empire, under the Orders of the moſt Mighty and Dreadful Potentates of the Earth, will receive by this Ordinary, an ample Information of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Events which have happened in <hi>Portugal:</hi> And I have alſo inform'd him of the ſtrange Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which do much weaken the Strength of <hi>Spain,</hi> and notably mortifie the Pride of this haughty Nation. I have made known to him, that <hi>Portugal</hi> has already made choice of a King, and that <hi>Catalonia</hi> is departing from her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. But, I have given him no Account of the choice Memoirs, which I ſend thee; with which thou maiſt make Advantage, if thereby thou canſt find the way of introducing thy ſelf to the <hi>Grand Vizir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou maiſt then ſay to this great Miniſter, That thou haſt received the Memoirs thou preſenteſt him with, and aſſure him thou haſt tranſlated them out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>Arabick;</hi> and thou muſt tranſcribe them with thine own Hand, that they may not appear to come from me.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain, Philip</hi> II. died of a ſhameful Diſeaſe, which happens only to baſe People; which appeared a Chaſtiſement from Heaven, for having, like <hi>David,</hi> numbred the People which dwell in the Countries ſubject to him, to make known to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Greatneſs of his Power.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, this Monarch reckoned as far as 750 Cities, erected into Biſhopricks; therein compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending 60 Arch-biſhopricks: that he had Abbies 11400, Chapters 9230, as many Collegiate Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals; Pariſh-Churches 127000, Hoſpitals 4000, Confraternities 23000, Congregations of <hi>Seculars</hi> 2300, Houſes of Entertainment for Pilgrims 3000, 46000 Convents of Religious People; and of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins 13500, with 15200 Chapels, wherein <hi>Maſs</hi> is ſaid, as well as in publick Churches, as particular Houſes and Priſons.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:46436:156"/>
                  <p>And after an exact ſearch, this King found, that to ſerve ſo great a number of <hi>Churches, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, Convents, Hoſpitals</hi> and <hi>Chapels,</hi> there were 12900 <hi>Religious, Monks, Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Clerks;</hi> amongſt whom there might be found 12400 <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which celebrate what the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call the <hi>Maſs.</hi> And, to maintain ſo many People, 'twas computed that the Revenue for this amounted to 3000000 of <hi>Roman</hi> Crowns, without reckoning the Alms which were diſtributed every day, which amount to the Summ of 4000000 of Gold.</p>
                  <p>The curioſity of this Prince went farther; he would know the Number of all his Royal Officers, Governours of Provinces, Towns, Caſtles and Cittadels; and, in fine, of all Officers as well of Sea as Land, Judges, Juſticiaries of all kinds, and of all thoſe who had Patents from him or his Viceroys. And he found they were 83000 who were employed under Letters ſealed with his Hand, and 360000 who had them ſigned under his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>He would not know the Number of Perſons that lived in his States, leſt he ſhould become too proud; and to prevent his fall, ſaid he, into the Sin of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Which he yet could not avoid in his own Perſon, as I have already ſaid; <hi>God</hi> having ſpared his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who had otherwiſe ſufficiently ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>One may now ſay, that this puiſſant Monarchy begins to be diſmembred by the loſs of ſo many Provinces, Kingdoms, and Places; and that <hi>Philip</hi> II. knew not the full Extent of his Power: <hi>Philip</hi> III. knew not the Greatneſs of his Forces, nor the Riches which he poſſeſſes, becauſe his Miniſters go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned him: and <hi>Philip</hi> IV. not ſeeing when he might ſee, could not ſee at laſt when he would.</p>
                  <p>I think I have ſaid enough to thee to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Do now what thou can'ſt, to make thy ſelf underſtood by Perſons to whom theſe Advices
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46436:156"/>may be agreeable or profitable: And if thou believeſt, the Knowledge of theſe things may be acceptable to the Invincible <hi>Vizir,</hi> who is one of the Lights of the World. Endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Favour of this great Man, who governs all the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and to whom the <hi>Divine Alcoran</hi> ſerves for a Law. I embrace thee, and cordially kiſs thee, with the Lips of my Soul, if a man may ſo expreſs himſelf. <hi>Adieu.</hi>

                  <p>THe Poſts which came ſome few days paſt here, have brought ill News.

This Loſs has much afflicted the <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi>

                     </gap>ms to be Thunder-ſtruck. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcourſe and argue hereupon according to their different Humours, moſt making the Loſs greater than 'twas. But thoſe who have loſt their Kinsfolks, threaten Revenge; and only thoſe that have heard of the Death of their Friends are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, becauſe their Grief is above Expreſſion. But all in general, appear in ſuch Conſternation, as would make a man imagine this Stroak is irreparable; ſo true is it, that Loſſes are inſufferable to thoſe that are not accuſtomed to loſe.</p>
                  <p>One would think, to hear the <hi>French</hi> talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are already at the Walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that theſe rebellious Princes are ready to give an Aſſault to this great Town. They have retired
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46436:157"/>into a place which they ſay is impregnable, and which belongs to a <hi>French</hi> Lord; which Place is called <hi>Sedan,</hi> and 'tis not far hence where this Bloody Battle was fought, wherein the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were worſted; but the <hi>Malecontents</hi> are much afflicted at the loſs of their General, who was kill'd in the heat of the Fight. Some ſay, he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Treachery, others by the Enemy; and there are who affirm, That Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> got rid of him by means of an Aſſaſſin, whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in his Troops; others alſo ſay, he killed himſelf by lifting up the Viſir of his Helmet with his Piſtol, which diſcharged it ſelf; however, there is dead in the Perſon of this Prince, a Prince of great Valour.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make thee a Recital of this Adventure; I ſhall learn thee Motives of this War; inform thee who were the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> and their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and, in fine, by what Cabals this Tempeſt is raiſed; that thou mayeſt know, great and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Prop of the <hi>Ottaman</hi> Empire, that Ambition and Jealouſie cauſe Diſorders in <hi>France,</hi> as well as in other Countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lewis de Bourbon,</hi> Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> was a Prince of the Bloud; he had ſuch a fierceneſs in his Youth, as drove away all from him, who once came near him; but having got over this Humour which diſobliged every body, he became popular, and ſo courteous, that he was now followed as much as he was ſhun'd before. He uſed the <hi>Nobility</hi> as became their Quality; had acquired the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of other Princes, and thoſe of inferiour Rank could not enough admire him. He was adored by the Soldiery, beloved and eſteemed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and he had, in a word, ſo behaved himſelf that he had gotten the general Applauſe.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> has a Niece named <hi>Madam de Combalet,</hi> who having been married to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46436:157"/>aſpired to an higher Match, ſeeing all things to give place and humble themſelves before her Uncle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> deſigned by the Marriage of this Neece, to procure himſelf ſuch a puiſſant Prop, that nothing ſhould be able to overthrow his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or oppoſe his Authority: He pretended alſo, his Life would be more in ſafety; and that ſuch an Alliance, with thoſe he already had, would put him out of a Capacity of being ever attackt by any Enemies, ſecret or declared, whoſe Number encreaſed as faſt as his Authority.</p>
                  <p>Several Affirm, this Prieſt had Ambition enough to give an Heir, who might one day aſcend the Throne; when it appeared by the Queen's Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, the King could have no Child to ſucceed him.</p>
                  <p>But the State of Affairs being changed, he took other meaſures; and thinking of having the <hi>Count</hi> in his Alliance, he cauſed the Propoſals of this Marriage of his Neece to be offered the Prince, by one of his moſt intimate Confidents; who offered him at the ſame time conſiderable Summs of Money, and Dignities, to make him Heir of all his vaſt Eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to procure him the greateſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Kingdom, which is that of <hi>Conſtable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſſon's</hi> Anſwer to him that made the Propoſal, was a Box on the Ear; being in an extream Paſſion, at any one's daring to offer him a Match ſo greatly beneath him, when Madam <hi>de Combalet</hi> was the Widow of a Gentleman of a mean condition, and Neece to a <hi>Cardinal</hi> whom he hated, and himſelf a Prince of the Bloud.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Meſſenger, deſirous his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould ſucceed, was not repelled by this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. He inſiſted on the Vertue of the <hi>Cardinal's</hi> Neece, ſaying ſhe would be courted by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of <hi>France:</hi> and added farther in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46436:158"/>of this Lady. That ſhe was a Virgin, altho' married; becauſe her Husband out of reſpect, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not approach her; and that Heaven had ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, that this Adventure ſhould be found written in the Anagram of her Name,</p>
                  <p>This Miniſter could not diſſemble his Vexation at the Refuſal; his Choler became exceſſive, and he reſolved to practiſe his uſual Maxim, <hi>of violently perſecuting thoſe, whoſe Friendſhip he had ſought with moſt Eagerneſs.</hi> He therefore wholly ſet himſelf againſt this Prince, ſpake all the Ill he could of him, publickly threatned his Enemy; but he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued him not, looking on the <hi>Cardinal</hi> as beneath his Notice.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> plotted to put his Threats into Execution, and brought the King in to countenance him by his Authority; which obliged the <hi>Count</hi> to abſent himſelf, and make a Voyage into <hi>Italy,</hi> to avoid the Storm he was threatned with. Yet his Voyage laſted not long, and at his Return the <hi>Cardinal</hi> did all he could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Say not that thoſe are Fools who are in Love, but I muſt needs think, that thoſe who believe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are not overladen with Diſcretion. 'Tis hard for a Man always to keep himſelf from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Paſſion; but 'tis not ſo hard for a man to keep himſelf from believing things with too great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and from being caught with Falſhoods, which are the moſt conſtant Attendants of Women.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt ſpoke the Truth to me, in ſending me the Balm and Aloes I wrote for; and I ſhall not anſwer thee with Lyes, in ſpeaking of <hi>Daria,</hi> who is the Subject of the Letter which I received from thee. Let me thank thee, without ſaying any thing of the Preſent thou madeſt me, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry magnificent and acceptable; and ſuffer me to complain to thee freely of the Hurt which another has done me. I need not conſult my Regiſter, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46436:161"/>whatever I wrote to thee about this <hi>Greek,</hi> my Heart which is yet full of it, reproaches me every Moment, for having ſaid too much to thee on that Subject.</p>
                  <p>Never any thing appeared to me ſo deſirable, as that Herb which <hi>Homer</hi> called <hi>Nepente,</hi> to cure me of the cruel Diſtemper, with which I am tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This Prince of Poets makes a Queen of our <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to preſent this admirable <hi>Simple</hi> to <hi>Helena,</hi> which has the Virtue of appeaſing immediately all Dolours, and makes us forget the Vexations and Offences offered us. But thou wilt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me, unleſs I tell thee clearly, That <hi>Daria</hi> has forgotten all the Promiſes ſhe made me, as ſoon as ever ſhe was from me; not remembring in any ſort my Love. 'Tis true, ſhe wrote twice to me ſince her Departure, but in ſo cold a Style, that it is plainly ſeen, her Heart is as cold as Ice to me. As ſoon as ever ſhe ſaw her ſelf in the Arms of her Husband, ſhe made him a Sacrifice of my Paſſion; and, the better to make her Court to him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him of her Fidelity, ſhe delivered to him my Letters. The Husband laughed in reading them, and ſaid to her, in a jear to me: <hi>A man then, ſo deſperately in love, has onely ſighed and wrote? He has done ſomething more</hi> (replyed this Diſſembling Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) <hi>having promiſed to ſend me a Box of white Balm of</hi> Mecha, <hi>and Aloes-Wood, to perfume me, which yet I do not expect to receive ſo ſoon, and perhaps never: For, if</hi> Mahmut <hi>be not become a Fool, he will as ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me, as I ſhall certainly forget him. And what! haſt thou promiſed, this</hi> Barbarian? replyed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Husband. <hi>I promiſed,</hi> replyed <hi>Daria, to ſend with my Picture, that of the moſt chaſte of all Women; which yet I do not pretend to do, without your Conſent, nay, and Command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I now inform thee, comes from a place which makes me not at all doubt the certainty
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46436:162"/>of it. But having learnt by what I related, the Virtue of this Woman, now hear what the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand's was; who having ſeen my Picture, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Painter that drew it, embraced ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly his Wife, whom he reſpected as a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Example of Conjugal Fidelity. Thou wilt wonder at <hi>Daria</hi>'s Weakneſs, in ſhewing him my Picture; ſhe did do it, and her Confidence has turned to Account, ſhe having received a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand chaſte Embraces for a Recompenſe. Thou ſeeſt here the Happineſs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Women, who have Husbands who take ſo favourably the Offences done them during their Abſence.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Daria</hi>'s Picture does not come; ſhe returns no more Anſwers to my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which has diſcouraged me to write to her for ſome time. My Paſſion begins not to be ſo violent; and, this great Fire which conſumed me, will ſoon turn into Aſhes. I have been mightily miſtaken; for, it is only amongſt Perſons of an equal Condition, where true and laſting Friendſhips are to be found. Let us love, my dear <hi>Dgnet;</hi> let the Bonds of our Friendſhip be ſuch, as will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver break nor be diſſolved. <hi>Daria</hi> is really a great Example of Fidelity to her Husband; but, ſhe is alſo an Example of Inconftancy and Treachery, to a Lover who had ſacrificed all to her.</p>
                  <p>I am reſolved henceforward, to love no Woman; and, I am certain, my dear Friend, that my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall hold. Rejoyce with me at my Cure, and believe, that if a fine and charming Woman diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered my Brains, the good Humour and Patience of her Husband, has brought me again to my Senſes. My Adventure ſhould make thee careful, to avoid the Inconveniences; but, thou can'ſt not run that Riſque, being happy with the other <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmen</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who have Laws which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hinder them from falling into the like Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities.</p>

                  <p>I hope alſo thou wilt give over being my Rival, if thou haſt ever had any kindneſs for this ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Greek.</hi> If men muſt love once in their Lives, let them have a care of falling into thoſe Exceſſes which dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thou mayeſt well be tired with this long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but I ſhall end it, in ſending thee a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which one of the greateſt Wits in <hi>Spain</hi> has made of Women,</p>
                  <p>He ſays, <hi>They be the Sources of Life and Death; that they are to be conſidered as Fire, becauſe they uſe all that come near them as that Element does, yet they give Men a certain neceſſary Heat: They are fine things; bring Joy to Families and whole Towns; but are dangerous to keep, enflaming all that comes near them, and reducing them commonly into Aſhes. They uſually give a great Luſtre, but this Luſtre is never without ſuch a Smoak, as darkens the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and makes, them often ſhed Tears who only behold them. He that has no Commerce with Women, ſpends his Life in Melancholly, and yet they are ſeldom ſeen without Danger. The way to manage them, is not to do exceſſive things for them, no more than wholly to neglect them, A man oft obtains them eaſily, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly loſes them more eaſily.

                  <p>Thou art now above 50 Years of Age, and I not above 32, and yet I know thou reflecteſt not much hereupon, thinking thou haſt ſtill a long time to live. Thou art of a ſtrong Conſtitution, art a lover of Pleaſures, ſearching them every where, without any thoughts of Death, who will ſpare thee no more than others, whoſe Health is decayed; for <hi>he comes taking great ſtrides towards us all.</hi> Thou art very fortunate, I muſt needs ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Should the King, or <hi>Cardinal,</hi> near whom I live, know this Night, that <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who writes to thee, is one of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Spies, I ſhould loſe my Life, perhaps, before the next Light; yet, the fear of ſuch an Adventure, gives me no Diſquiet; having entirely ſacrificed my ſelf to the Maſter I ſerve, who commands all Men on the Earth. Should theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> put me to Death, I ſhall only finiſh a little ſooner that courſe, which I muſt certainly one day put an end to; and if I live, I ſhall have neither Recompence to expect, nor Pain to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
                  <p>Here is much talk about the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> yet, there has been more done againſt him, than ſaid. The <hi>French</hi> affirm, that in ſtripping this Prince of his Countries, he has been very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dealt with; for, Juſtice required more. There are, on the contrary, other People, who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46436:164"/>it is poſſible to do a greater plece of Injuſtice. In fine, every man ſpeaks after his manner.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid moreover, that this Sovereign being come again into the King's Favour, who had given him a Thouſand Teſtimonies of good Will, after what had paſſed in 1634, when this Court had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to complain of his Conduct; he drew down again afreſh the Indignation of <hi>France</hi> upon him, by a Fault which cannot be excuſed. I think, this Duke had concluded two Treaties that Year, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing a Submiſſion and eternal Obedience. He had the Honour to dine with the King; and having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him Homage for the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Bar,</hi> he again threw himſelf into the Arms of the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> although he had ſworn on the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> (a Book as much reſpected amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> is among the <hi>True Faithful,</hi>) That he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> what Wars ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe might find; that he would be perpetually fix'd to the Intereſts of that Crown, and never hold any Correſpondence with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> In conſideration of which, <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould re-eſtabliſh this Prince in his Eſtates, which he was to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der entirely, bating ſome Places, and the Capital, called <hi>Nanci,</hi> which he would retain during the War, as a Pledge for the performance of what he had ſworn to; and, which yet was to be given up, after the Concluſion of the Peace. 'Tis added, That this Sovereign, having occaſion to complain of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, and the Grandees of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who carry on the War in <hi>Flanders;</hi> he had written to the <hi>Cardinal Infant,</hi> Governor of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> a Letter to this purpoſe, and very near in theſe Words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King of</hi> Frante <hi>having required me, to joyn my ſelf with my Troops to his Army near</hi> Sedan; <hi>I would not obey this puiſſant King, much leſs your Higneſs; ſeeing the Towns ſubject to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>treat me as if I were an Enemy.</hi>

                  <p>The Ladies have had a great part in this Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> which has had, like all the Works of Women, a direful Event. This Prince being become amorous of a <hi>French</hi> Lady, was for repudiating his lawful Princeſs, to whom he owes all his Eſtate; beginning to ſeparate from her, that he might give himſelf entirely to the Counteſs of <hi>Cantecroix,</hi> whom he uſed as his real Wife.</p>
                  <p>Good People are ſorry for this Prince's Diſgrace, as believing his Condition to be paſt Remedy. The devout part ſay, That having been unjuſtly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Eſtates, <hi>God</hi> will work Miracles in his Favour; conſidering, no leſs than Three Hundred <hi>Saints;</hi> as they ſay, have been of his Family, which muſt needs reconcile him to the Favour of Heaven; amongſt which, is the famons <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> who won <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all <hi>Paleſtine</hi> from the <hi>Saracens;</hi> whom we muſt own to have been a great Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider his Courage, or Zeal for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which ought to make his Memory famous to all Ages.</p>
                  <p>I can tell thee nothing more certain on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, having endeavoured to be informed of what I write to thee, to ſatisfie thy Curioſity: and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I now recite, has paſt in <hi>France</hi> with little Noiſe, or rather with great Silence, as to me; for indeed, I muſt with ſhame confeſs, that I have ſcarce heard in <hi>Paris</hi> this Event, ſo famous throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man has nothing but what comes from Heaven; and commonly the ſtrongeſt, when he has Right on his ſide, ſubdues the weak, and enriches himſelf with his Spoils.</p>
                  <p>By the Law of Nature, every one has Right of judging his own Neceſſities, and the Greatneſs of the Danger wherein he finds himſelf; and, if it be contrary to Reaſon, I ſhould be Judge of my own
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46436:165"/>Danger, 'tis reaſonable another ſhould be ſo. But, the ſame Reaſon which eſtabliſhes another Judge of what concerns me, has made me, his Judge; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, gives me Authority to judge of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he ſhall give againſt me; and to decide, whether it be juſt, when 'tis favourable to me, or unjuſt, if it be contrary to my Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Nature has given all to Men, and thou and I, and all men have an equal Right to all things, and hence we have Power to do whatever we will, to poſſeſs and enjoy what we think is fitting; and yet, ſuch an extenſive Right, is juſt as if we had Right to nothing; For, at the ſame time I have Right to a thing which pleaſes me, another ſtronger than my ſelf, by virtue of the ſame Right, takes it from me, and enjoys it in ſpight of me. Hence it is, that one man invades ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame Right with which he defends himſelf, whence do, and will ſpring up always, the occaſions of Jealouſies and Diſcords which are amongſt men; which make them at continual Defiance with one another, and keeps them in a continual Watchfulneſs over their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this Liberty founded in Nature, which makes it lawful in time of War, to reſiſt and invade not only by open Force, but with all the ſecret Arts and Stratagems as can be deviſed; and, when a man would avoid the Danger he is in in fighting, and has his Enemy in his hands, he has right to uſe all means to avoid him, and ſecure himſelf from him.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt approve of theſe Reflexions, which ſhew thee the Natural Right thou haſt of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me, as being thy Inferiour; and, I hope, by what I have written, to have ſatisfied thy Curioſity; and, by my Submiſſion and Obedience, to have given thee a Proof of my profound Reſpects to thee.</p>

                  <p>LET me, moſt holy and patient <hi>Dervis,</hi> ſalute thee with my Head bowed down to the ground, with the greateſt Humility I am able. I now write to thee with my Feet naked, without either Hoſe or Shoes, as a Mark of my Reſpect and Veneration, which I have for thy Old Age, and the Admiration I have at thy incorruptible Innocency.</p>
                  <p>The kindneſs thou ſheweſt me by the long Letter I have received, has given me ſuch joy as I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; as makes me forget my paſt Pains, and hinders me from thinking of thoſe which are to happen to me; for, I can now willingly leave this World, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſuch Teſtimonies of thy Affection. Thy great Age does not aſtoniſh me ſeeing thy Father, who is yet alive, is 107 years old, and thou not above 82; which makes me hope to ſee a great while yet, both one and the other, draw down by their Prayers, and Merit of their good Actions, the Bleſſings of Heaven on the glorious Empire of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> to whom all the Empires and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the World ought to ſubmit. The Thirty Brethren who preſented themſelves to <hi>Selim,</hi> to be enrolled in the Troops which were to ſerve againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> made the Father, who had them all by one Woman, to paſs for the happieſt of all the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> in having the good Fortune to beget ſuch a number of the moſt noble <hi>Species</hi> in Nature. But thou and thy Father, muſt needs be more happy than this fertil Parent. Thy Father has fought, and come out victorious from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the Age, full of Scars and Sufferings,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46436:166"/>through the Force of his Courage, the Innccency of his Manners, and his great Sobriety: And, as to thy part, what haſt not thou done, to make thy ſelf the worthy Son of ſo glorious a Father? Thou haſt not only done, what thy Father did before thee; thou haſt acquired the ſame Vertues, and haſt ſo far out-done them, that one may ſay, thou haſt ſurpaſſed Vertue it ſelf. Thy Strength is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, in the midſt of Abſtinencies, and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities which thou undergoeſt; in which, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, thou canſt not be imitated. But Heaven, to whom only thou liveſt, will recompence in this World thy pure Faith, which the Enemy of Mankind can never weaken.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay, When <hi>God</hi> gave them the Commandments, he promiſed only <hi>long Life</hi> to ſuch who perfectly honoured thoſe, who, under <hi>God,</hi> brought them into the Light. If this be true, as 'tis very likely; tis not to be doubted, but that a <hi>Long Life</hi> is the Recompence which <hi>God</hi> gives thoſe who live well: And the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> who are Criticks, affirm, That Sin alone is the cauſe, that men do not live ſo long as they did before the <hi>Deluge;</hi> for, then they remained ſuch a while in Life, as would tempt one to think, they were to have been Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. They ſay, That after the <hi>Deluge, God</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Nature of Men; and inſtead of theſe great number of Years, which made up the Courſe of ſo long a Life, they cannot live at fartheſt above 120 years, and that there are few which arrive at 80; and whatever is beyond this, is Miſery and Torment; or a kind of Senſeleſneſs, which makes Men like Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>I know few People but what are agreed, One may cure or mitigate the Inconveniencies which happen to us; but, few are of Opinion, That Life can be lengthened; yet, if this be poſſible, we may then believe a Story which is believed here, and which happened the year paſt in <hi>Paris.</hi>

He was a Man of great Valour, had been highly ſerviceable to the Crown of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> and acquired the Reputation of an excellent Commander. The <hi>Emperor</hi> had offered him ſome time before great Recompences, and the Dignity of <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> if he would change his Maſter, and forſake the <hi>Confederates</hi> Party. He had alſo offered, thinking this might more move him, to make him <hi>General</hi> of his Army againſt the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> but he refuſed all theſe Offers, his Fidelity being unmoveable.</p>
                  <p>This great Captain was born in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> and when a Child, he fell down from a high Window, without receiving any Hurt; which made the King imagine, Heaven deſign'd him for ſome thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimakam <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople.</head>
                  <p>THis King here has mortified his <hi>Parliament,</hi> by the Advice of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are Bodies of Learned Men, who decide all Affairs in the Kingdom, as well Civil, as Criminal, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> has a larger Juriſdiction than all others, and as conſiderable Prerogatives. What I have to ſay on this Subject, has happened from the beginning of the laſt Year; and I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, becauſe I forgat to do it when the thing happened: And I will inform thee, before I enter on the Matter, what obliged heretofore the Kings of <hi>France</hi> to ſet up this great Seat of juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Kings of <hi>France,</hi> gave it Authority of approving and verifying the Edicts and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they ſhould make, which was a Bar which theſe wiſe Princes would fix between the People and the Sovereign Authority. Whence it appeared, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> was mix'd with <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy;</hi> without which the Wiſe have thought, that <hi>States</hi> could not long ſubſiſt. And the Princes of this Age have ſubmitted to a Tribunal re-eſtabliſhed by themſelves, the Reſolutions they take; to the end they may diſcharge themſelves towards <hi>God,</hi> to whom they are accountable, as well as other Men; and, to obtain Confidence from their Subjects, in taking from amongſt them Arbiters to regulate them. Yet, they have ever reſerved the Liberty of making uſe of their Abſolute Power, as is ſeen in their Letters Patents, where they forget not to inſert theſe Words, <hi>[For ſuch is our Will and Pleaſure.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:46436:169"/>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Monarchs</hi> alſo thought hereby to have found out a way to defend themſelves from the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of the Grandees, who often demanded ſuch things which could not be granted without Prejudice to the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of the now reigning King being out of danger of being ſhaken or deſtroyed, this <hi>Monarch</hi> having his Exchequer well ſtored, has valiant and experienced Captains, ſtout Soldiers, and numerous Armies, and good Fleets of Ships at Sea; whereby he would make known to this puiſſant Tribunal, That if it had been ſet up to aſſiſt the Kings by its Counſels when required, yet it muſt not pretend, that its Decrees ſhould become Laws to their Sovereigns. He went to the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> with all the Marks of Grandeur with which he is uſually attended on theſe Days of Ceremony, and with ſuch a great Company of <hi>Lords,</hi> as made the Power of this Monarch eaſily diſcerned. He gave theſe Gentlemen to underſtand, he would have them ratifie, without more adoe, the Orders he would ſend them, which they term <hi>Edicts,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them to be immediately enregiſtred. He afterwards gave them an expreſs Charge, not to concern themſelves henceforwards in Affairs of State; and to humble them the more, he declared to them, That he would be henceforward the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of Graces, and Offices, and beſtow Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to ſuch as deſerved them. He added here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto an Order of giving an account every Year to his Chancellour of their Deportments and to come and receive every year his Majeſty's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to continue them in their Offices. And, as a Mark of his Indignation and Authority, he put by the Preſident and ſome Counſellours from their Places.</p>
                  <p>This bold and politick Action was done (as I may ſay) in the midſt of Dancings and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46436:170"/>the more to denote the Monarch's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and, in the time of ſuch Magnificent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, as became the Pomp of the greateſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Palace of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Niece <hi>Mademoiſſelle de Breze</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Eldeſt Son, called the Duke <hi>D' Anguien;</hi> a Prince from whom the World expects great things, and whom all <hi>France</hi> believes will prove one of the Famouſeſt Princes in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catalonians</hi> are obſtinate in their Revolt; their Deputies have been already ſeen in this <hi>Court,</hi> to entreat a good Supply from this King; and, it is not to be doubted, but they will earneſtly ſue for his Protection: And, <hi>France</hi> has already ſent Troops near thoſe Parts, and its Fleet appears on the Coaſts, to encourage this Nation, and mortifie the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There are a great many Troops rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here; and, this <hi>Monarch</hi> will have in the <hi>Spring</hi> eight Armies, commanded by <hi>Generals</hi> of great Valour and Experience, beſides theſe two Fleets; ſo that <hi>Germany, Lorrain,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are like to be Expoſed to the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an impoveriſhing War. Only <hi>Germany</hi> ſeems to me able to defend it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The vaſt <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>French</hi>-Miniſter, aſtoniſhes all the Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> he breaks all their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and makes a ſecret War againſt them in their own <hi>Courts.</hi> Nothing can eſcape his vigilant Care; he keeps his own Secrets ſo ſtrictly, that his neareſt Friends cannot diſcover them. His Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority are ſo great, that the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> are nothing in compariſon of him, and his Fame makes him as much reſpected Abroad as at Home.</p>
                  <p>His Friends affirm, He is ignorant of nothing which is projected in <hi>Europe. England</hi> is the Place which he has laſt attackt, its Civil Wars owing their Original to his Deſigns.</p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:46436:170"/>
                  <p>I pray Heavens favour thy juſt Pretenſions, and every day increaſe thy Heroick Vertues.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HE of whom I wrote ſo many particulars, ſome Moons ago, to obey, as I ought, the expreſs Command thou laidſt upon me; not only is ſtill living, but is more abſolute than ever, in what concerns his Miniſtry, Yet is it falſe, that this <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> finding nothing more (as thou writeſt to me, 'tis talked of in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) to ſatisfie his Ambition, (which puts him ſtill upon deſiring ſomething farther, being become the abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of what depends on the Kingdom of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII.) had deſigns of making himſelf abſolute Maſter of what concerns Religion. But, he was too knowing a Man, to deſign the being the <hi>Superiour General</hi> of all the <hi>French Derviſes;</hi> a thing which neither the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor the <hi>Pope</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. I rather think, this Miniſter's Deſign has been, to ſubject all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire would have ſome reaſon to be afraid, were all the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelates wiſe enough to chuſe this Man for their <hi>Pope.</hi> We ſhould ſee in a ſhort time, all <hi>Aſia</hi> agitated by his Intrigues, againſt the Followers of the great <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46436:171"/>thoſe that follow <hi>Ali,</hi> would not enjoy a much greater Security. Thou knoweſt, that the greateſt Marks which the <hi>Popes</hi> can give of their Piety du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their <hi>Pontificat,</hi> is to ſtir up Wars, and make Leagues againſt us to overthrow our Empire. Think then what this great Man would do, were he the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with thoſe Abilities, and great Intelligences which he every where keeps; ſeeing, that being only a Subject, and Miniſter of one Prince, he ſo governs himſelf, that there's no Nation how far ſo ever diſtant, but holds its Eyes open on his Conduct: And a <hi>Pope</hi> being always choſen from amongſt the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> now reigning being very old, it may happen that this dangerous man ſhall be choſen.</p>
                  <p>Thou then, whoſe pure Life makes us believe thou art a <hi>Saint,</hi> pray the great <hi>God</hi> to hinder ſuch an Event, which will without queſtion diſturb the Empire of him whom he has choſen to humble all other Potentates, and ſhew on Earth the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power; and, rather than ſuch a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſhould befall us, pray Him that has created all things, that this man's Eyes be opened to know and embrace the <hi>true Faith:</hi> For, it were better, (if I may ſay ſo without diſpleaſing thee) that this <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſhould be a bad <hi>Mufti</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than a good <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Head of all the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that a Foreign King conſulted this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, (for he is held in as great Veneration as if he was one,) what Conduct he ſhould hold to live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely: And it is ſaid, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> made this Anſwer: <hi>That Kings ſhould live in Fear, and then they would live in Safety; it being certain, they would receive no Poyſon from the Hands of thoſe who do not preſent them their Drink, no more than they can receive Wounds from thoſe, whom they keep at a great Diſtance from them. Thoſe who will not flatter them, will not

                  <p>IT may be ſaid, I have eſcaped from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sickneſs, and remain in Life, only to hear the Complaints of my Friends, who recite to me their Misfortunes; and of my Kindred, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me with the Loſſes they have ſuſtain'd. Thou addeſt, my dear Mother, a new Torment to the Pains I already ſuffer, by ſhedding ſo many fruitleſs Tears, O! how cruel is my Country, that gives ſo many Occaſions of Affliction to thoſe to whom ſhe has given their Birth! Thou haſt loſt the greateſt part of thine Eſtate, in the Fire of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Death has deprived thee of thy ſecond Husband. I was but a Child when my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dyed, ſo that I could not judge then of thy Grief; neither was I ſenſible of my own Loſs. Now that I am a Man, I enter into thy Sentiments, I ſhare in thy Grief, and ſhall do all I can to comfort thee.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:46436:172"/>
                  <p>Thou haſt loſt thy firſt and ſecond Husband, and thou haſt reaſon to afflict thy ſelf. If the firſt was an honeſt man, 'tis certain the other loved thee extreamly: And the Charms of thy Countenance have not a little ſerved thee to acquire the Affection of theſe Two Husbands, which thou kneweſt how to keep by thy Complacencies and blind Obedience to their Wills; and by ſuch a prudent Carriage, as, one may ſay, thou wouldſt force them to love thee, hadſt thou not done it by the Charms of thy Beauty.</p>
                  <p>But, what ſhall we do in this thy Extream Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in the troubleſome Condition I am for the Grief thou endureſt, which mingles my Ink with my Tears? Yet we muſt endeavour to be comforted with a firm Reſolution, not to afflict our ſelves but at the Loſs of ſuch things which will never be in our power to recover. Thou, at the loſs of the Reputation which thou haſt acquired of a Vertuous Woman; and I, at that of an Honeſt Man.</p>
                  <p>When my Father dyed, 'twas not all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy nor Eloquence of the <hi>Greeks</hi> which could comfort thee, thy Affliction was ſtronger than all their Reaſons: and, when thoſe officious Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had forſaken thee, thou ſoughteſt Eaſe to thy Trouble in a new Spouſe. Him now thou haſt loſt, but now thou art ſtill in a Condition of hindring this Loſs from being irreparable. Thy Vertue has never been queſtioned, and thou art not as yet ſo old, but thou mayſt think of another Husband. Seek a Third, which may make thee forget thy Sorrow for the ſecond. And if thou findeſt him not immediately, or if thou hadſt ſome trouble in ſeeking a like Comfort to thy Affliction, receive in this Letter the Tears of another Mother, which will ſhew thee there is a Woman of a far higher Condition, that is more afflicted than thou art.</p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:46436:172"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paris</hi> is ſtill full of the Cries and Sighs which come from a Princeſs of the Firſt Rank. She has now loſt a great Prince, her Son, who is ſlain in a Battel which he had won by a ſtrong Army, of which he was <hi>General.</hi> Read in my Letter the lively and tender Expreſſions of the Grief of this illuſtrious Mother, which draw Compaſſion from his Enemies, who are forced by the Rules of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility to make her Viſits. Thus does ſhe ſpeak every day and hour, to Perſons who come to viſit her; and when there's no body, ſhe thus ſpeaks to her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This unfortunate Woman is not a Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſighing; and one would think by her Language, ſhe intended to recall the Soul which has quitted the Body of her Son, the unhappy <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons. Poor</hi> Count, <hi>a Son ſo tenderly loved, and ſo greatly deſerved it; where is thy Body now to be found, dyed in bloud, and in that of the Enemies? What Victory? Where are thoſe Glorious Marks, that ſhould give me ſo great Joy, and which give me ſuch Cauſe of Deſpair? Why did I bring thee forth into the World, unfortunate Son, if I muſt ſo ſoon loſe thee? Miſerable Mother, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Son! How art thou a Conqueror, when I ſee no other Trophy of thy Victory, than thy Death? I hear from all Parts that the</hi> Count <hi>is Victorious and yet I hear every where that his Enemies rejoyce. I ſee, dear Son, all thy Domeſticks that followed thee, return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wounds, and yet I do not ſee their Maſter. None of them can tell me where he is, and in what place their</hi> General <hi>lies, who fought with ſo great Valour, and Succeſs to his Party. But, they are all agreed, the Battel was won, that my Son is a Conqueror, and that he has loſt his Life. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Fight, which has made equally bewayled, the Death of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> General <hi>by his Mother, and the Defeat by the vanquiſhed. Would to</hi> God <hi>thou hadſt been vanquiſhed, thou mighteſt have lived, I ſhould not have bin in this
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46436:173"/>condition of following thee. 'Twould have been no Shame to have been defeated, it would have been only a Misfortune, which would have been common to thee with</hi> Pompey <hi>and</hi> Hannibal, <hi>to whom Antiquity had nothing to impute, but their ill Fortune. A ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, a Pardon, or a Peace, might make all that is paſt forgotten.

But to my Grief nothing of this has hapned. Alas! the Stay of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Methinks I ſee my Son's Murtherers give him the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stroak in the Heat of the Fight, and in the inſtant he was going to enjoy his Victory. Ah! my dear Son, Ah! unfortunate Mother! why did not I breath out my laſt on the dead body of this Son, ſo worthy the Eſteem of all the World, and whom I ſo dearly loved? Why didſt not thou, too powerful Miniſter, give me the Mortal Blow, rather than let me ſee ſo ſad a Tragedy? Do you kill me that hear me; or thou, my Son, give me thy Hand to deſcend into the Grave, where thou art to be buried.</hi>

                  <p>Dear Mother, if thou canſt not comfort thy ſelf by ſo great an Example of Misfortune to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it will be hard for thy Son to ſay any thing which can diminiſh thy Grief. Imitate this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Woman, who having ſuffered whatever Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Deſpair can do to a Mother who loves vehemently, and with Reaſon ſuffers her ſelf to be perſwaded, not to give en entire Victory to her Enemies, who triumph ſtill over her Son, by the Grief which they ſee his Death has cauſed. She has been ruled by the Advice of her Friends, and received great Comfort from a Letter ſent her by the King, written with his own Hands:</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Couſin,</hi> The Grief which you ſhow at your late Loſs, obliges me to teſtifie the Share which I have in it, and the Diſpleaſure I conceive at the fault of him which has cauſed it. And though I ought not to be ſorry by reaſon of the Conjuncture wherein it has hapned, yet I muſt heartily condole with you, and contribute what I am able to your Conſolation.</q>
                  <p>I can ſay nothing more to thee, my moſt honoured mother, unleſs it be, that thou ſhalt always have
<pb facs="tcp:46436:174"/>in me a moſt obedient Son; and if thou takeſt a Third Husband, thou wilt be perhaps leſs unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but pleaſe thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The great <hi>God,</hi> who has created all Things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for their Neceſſities by his Infinite Goodneſs, comfort and fill thee with his Bleſſings.</p>

Moon of the year 1637. has loſt the Credit which he had with the King, and is at preſent diſgraced. The Opinion of his Valour at <hi>Court</hi> is much leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his not hindring, with the Fleet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from putting Succours into <hi>Tarragone,</hi> a famous Sea-Port near <hi>Barcellona.</hi> They loſt the laſt year, twelve Gallies in Fight againſt the <hi>French</hi> Naval Forces; but having fitted a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Fleet, they have put into this Place the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours they intended. The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> could not, or would not hinder them; which will be the cauſe, that this Place will not come ſo ſoon under the Power of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that this Prelate was baniſht <hi>France,</hi> and was retired into a City ſituated on the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> named <hi>Avignon,</hi> and belongs to the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate.</p>
                  <p>It being a thing very uſual to run down the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, all the World blames this Prelate, having not always met with equal Succeſs on the Sea in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46436:174"/>the Employs he ſought, and which did not at all agree with his Function of <hi>Archbiſhop;</hi> which he might have performed with Applauſe, in imitating his Predeceſſor who was his Brother, the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis;</hi> and who had left him a Dioceſs well regulated, rich, furniſhed with great ſtore of Churches well ſerved, Paſtors of great Piety and Learning, whom this man had procured and ſetled in his Dioceſs with great Care, which made his Death extreamly lamented.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catalonions</hi> are at length become this King's Subjects; they maintain their Revolt with the <hi>French</hi> Forces, and ſtrengthen themſelves after the Example of the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> They fight with ſuch Courage, that they come off continually Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; but, I ſhall make no Relation of their Fights, nor of the Blood which is ſpilt on either ſide, which are Matters I do not care to treat of.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimakam.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Cardinal</hi> Favourite of <hi>France,</hi> has ſuch long Hands, that he makes Seizures in thoſe places which are not ſubject to his Juriſdiction; and when he has made them, he keeps them without any thoughts of reſtoring them. There's no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability at preſent, That this bold <hi>Politician</hi> will lay hands on what belongs to the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> However, I have ſome Reaſon to write this:</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:46436:175"/>
                  <p>There has been carry'd ſome days ſince an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Priſoner into the Caſtle of the Wood of <hi>Vincennes;</hi> and, thou ſhalt hear this new way of apprehending a great Man in another's Houſe, and in the <hi>Court</hi> of a Foreign Sovereign, who is abſolute in his own Eſtates. This Priſoner was apprehended in the midſt of the fineſt Ladies in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Turin,</hi> at a magnificent Ball which the Dutcheſs Regent of this Eſtate gave in her Palace. It was this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs whom I mentioned to thee, who was Widow to <hi>Victor Amadaeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Siſter to the King which now ſo happily reigns over the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dutcheſs, who had a particular Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this Priſoner, could not behold this Exploit of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s without extream Vexation. His Name is, if I be not miſtaken, Count <hi>Philip a' Aglie,</hi> a Perſon of great Quality; and, whoſe excellent Parts and Courage, do yet render him more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious than his Birth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not yet known, why the <hi>Cardinal</hi> undertook ſuch a bold Stroak; though 'tis ſaid, the Council of <hi>France</hi> has had great reaſons to ſecure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Favourite. The chief Motive, they ſay, was, That he was caarying on ſome Deſigns againſt the Intereſts of this Crown with the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Savoy;</hi> whom 'tis thought, he would have married to the Widow of <hi>Amadaeus</hi> his Brother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> attempted not to carry off <hi>Count Philip,</hi> till having made ſeveral Tryals to remove him from the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> under the pretence of ſome Embaſſie, to which he would never conſent; ſo that his Obſtinacy coſt him his Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> greatly complains, and reproaches the King her Brother with the Violation of the Right of Nations and <hi>Sovereignty;</hi> but only her own Court are ſenſible to theſe Complaints, they being not heard in that of <hi>France;</hi> and her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46436:175"/>has been ſeen there, in a ſupplicant Poſture, humbly ſuing for the <hi>Count</hi>'s Liberty; or that he might be ſent on an Embaſſie to <hi>Rome;</hi> or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, That in leaving the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> he might be impriſoned ſomewhere in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> anſwered the Supplications of the Ambaſſador of <hi>Savoy,</hi> That the King, his Maſter, did not apprehend <hi>Philip,</hi> and bring him into <hi>France,</hi> but out of regard to the Intereſts of his Siſter of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and that ſhe might be aſſured, that for her ſake he ſhould be well uſed.</p>
                  <p>Thou maiſt ſee by this Anſwer a great Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, and frivolous Reaſonings, which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently denote, that this great Miniſter does not love to be contradicted, or oppoſed in the Reſolutions he takes; and if an Account of what's done in the World, muſt be given to any one man alone, he would take it very ill, if it were to any body but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not fail to ſend thee the Books thou requir'ſt, and inform thee the beſt I can of the falſe or true <hi>D. Sebaſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whom his Subjects do believe to be ſtill alive, when I have made ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Enquiries into the Truth of the Matter.

                  <p>THere was found laſt Night, a Man dead in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> who ſeems not to be above 30 Years old; he is a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and had about him a Letter, or <hi>Memoir,</hi> which it ſeems he had written to ſome Confident at <hi>Madrid,</hi> in theſe Terms:</p>

                        <hi>Cardinal Richlieu</hi> told me, he did not know the Hand nor Signature of Count <hi>Olivarez</hi>'s Secretary; and that when he ſhould fill up his ſigned Blank; which I preſented him, and let fall the pretended Letter of this Secretary into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Hands, he ſaw not what Advantage could reſult hence to the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Maſter.

                     <hi>GOD</hi> be praiſed, thy <hi>Patriarch Elias,</hi> and his Companion; foraſmuch, as I ſee thou art a <hi>Saint,</hi> and content in the Religion of the <hi>Bare-footed Fryars</hi> which thou haſt embraced. Thou ſtirreſt me up to do Good, and encourageſt me to ſuffer, and become ſerious enough to renounce the Pleaſures of the World, ſeeing thou traceſt me a Way ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to walk in, in order to arrive at Heaven. I did not believe indeed, I confeſs it, thou wert endued with that Conſtancy; and was afraid, thou wouldſt change; but, ſeeing thou haſt the courage of keeping thy Reſolution, and enduring all the Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is to be met with in that kind of Life which thou haſt embraced; I am ſorry for my Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and profeſs I have all due Eſteem for thee. I love thee as much as one honeſt Man ought to love another, who, having found out the <hi>True Good,</hi> has ran impetuouſly after it; and who has paſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from a ſoft and voluptuous Life, to the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of an auſtere Religion, in ſearch of an aſſured Port, which is more uſually found in Sufferings and Macerations, than in Delights and Pleaſures. There is one thing amongſt others, which extreamly pleaſes
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46436:177"/>me, in the <hi>Order</hi> thou haſt entred; All things are in Common amongſt you; one Key opens an hundred Doors; you have no <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum;</hi> all clad in the ſame Faſhion, and all go bare-footed; you eat at the ſame Table, and no body has better or worſe Fare than another. In fine, your Prayers are the ſame, and ſo are your Vows of Poverty,</p>
                  <p>But, prithee tell me, What would a Thief have found in thy Cell, whom I ſaw yeſterday hanged with a Key about his Neck? He had the Dexterity of opening with this Key all ſorts of Locks, and has done a Thouſand Roguiſh Exploits, which have at length brought him to the Gallows. He told the People, he died a moſt happy Man, as having pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed with great Succeſs, an Art inferiour to none; That the only Crime he thought he had been guilty of for this 30 Years, was his committing but ſmall Thefts; That had he found the Doors always open, he had never entred into any Houſe; and he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magiſtrates to chaſtiſe only thoſe, who ſuffered themſelves to be robbed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors have written, There's no Law which allots Penalties to thoſe that rob with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Ingenuity; thus call they thoſe who ſteal wherewithal to appeaſe the Envious, who would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, the Witneſſes which might ſerve to convict them, and the Magiſtrates by whom they are to be judged: So that the Thief that ſhall have ſtoln for himſelf, and for all others I now mention'd, ſhall be ever ſent away abſolved. Which makes me think, that Theft is of the Nature of Women; for, both one, and the other ſeem at this day to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Evils, juſt as Keys ſeem only good now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days to preſerve what may be ſtoln, and not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being ſo.</p>
                  <p>How many things has the Injuſtice of ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple authorized for the Safeguard of a Town? 'Tis not enough to have a ſtrong Garriſon of Soldiers;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46436:177"/>Three Elements are not ſufficient to defend it againſt a greater Power that would oppreſs it. The Earth is raiſed, to make thereof Trenches; the deepeſt Ditches are dried up, whatever quantity of Water may be in them; and, Fire is encloſed in Cannons; the Effects of which are terrible. If thou ſurveyeſt <hi>Italy,</hi> thou wilt find in ſeveral Towns, Palaces which have more Gates than <hi>Thebes</hi> had heretofore: And, if thou counteſt the Keys which ſerve to open them, thou wilt find the Iron they are made of, to coſt more than the Doors themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Men are not contented to uſe theſe Keys, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common Uſe they ſeem to be deſigned for; their Ambition makes them ſerve for Marks of Honour in ſeveral Princes <hi>Courts,</hi> where they be Recompences for Services, for Vertue and Valour. The Golden Key in <hi>Spain,</hi> which the great <hi>Lords</hi> wear, denotes, That they know how to open the Gate of Favour. And, 'tis the ſame in <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſpecially in the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Court.</p>
                  <p>Happy was <hi>Ancient Rome,</hi> whoſe Citizens were ſo wiſe, that being adviſed to turn the Front of their Houſes on that ſide where they could not be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Neighbours, they anſwered the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect; <hi>We rather deſire our Houſes may be over-look'd into, becauſe we do nothing wherein we fear a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</hi> Whereas <hi>Modern Rome,</hi> on the contrary, may be termed unhappy, wherein there are not enough Gates, and Porters of them, to conceal what is done in the moſt retired places of their Palaces.</p>
                  <p>It is in this City, where Luxury grew to that height under the firſt <hi>Emperors;</hi> that all Mens Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were to find out new Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>But, I muſt end this Diſcourſe of Keys, of Doors, and Door-keepers; I muſt not expect to reform the World, nor would I weary thy Patience. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me my paſſing from the Cell, to the Story of the Thief whom I ſaw executed; and from the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46436:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thief, to a Diſcourſe of Keys, and other things with which I have entertained thee. I was ſo full of it, that I could not forbear the Diſcourſe, no more than I can now to ſpeak of the Subtilty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have vaunted of the Worth of their <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> by the great Number of the Keys which belong to it; like that fooliſh <hi>Emperor,</hi> who valued the Greatneſs of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the great weight of <hi>Spiders Webs</hi> which were there: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> affirm, There are ſo many Doors to this Stately E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice, that the Keys which ſerve to open them, weigh above Ten Thouſand Weight.</p>
                  <p>But, 'tis time to end this tireſome Letter.

                     <hi>To the Venerable</hi> Mufti.</head>
                  <p>THou wilt not think me troubleſome, if thou remembreſt the Order thou haft given me; and ſought rather to hazard the tiring thee by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Letters, than be accuſed of Neglect for not obeying thee. Obedience muſt needs be agreeable, where the Command is made with Wiſdom. When I write to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> 'tis in trembling; and, if I write to the <hi>Kaimakam,</hi> I am not without Hope; and, I ſend no Letter to the other <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> without Inquietude, and great Trouble. As to what concerns my Friends, I divert my ſelf in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them. But, when it is to thee that I write, I may ſay 'tis, that I may hope, live, and obtain in the <hi>other World,</hi> that happy State ſpoken of by our <hi>Holy Prophet;</hi> that Life which is to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of all thoſe, who ſhall perform good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whilſt they dwell among Men.</p>
                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> would willingly be abſolute in Matters of Religion, as thou art; he would alſo be thought a <hi>Saint;</hi> but he knows not how to be one: And, indeed, he would be every thing. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he does abundance of things which thou doſt not, and pretends to be above thee, becauſe he does not live as thou doſt. This Man, whoſe Head is full of the Affairs of the World, concerns himſelf in whatever paſſes in <hi>Europe;</hi> one only Employ cannot ſatisfie him; he is not contented with being the Favourite of a great King, under whoſe Authority he governs all things: Some time ago, 'twas reported he would make himſelf a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</hi> He aſpires extream high, undertakes the moſt difficult Matters, and takes a ſingular Pleaſure
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46436:179"/>in making uſe of extraordinary Means for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Projects, that Poſterity, and Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may write, That being come into the World with a ſmall Fortune, he died Rich; and being born in the Condition of a private Man, he lived in the State of a great Prince: Obſerve (<hi>Venerable Prince</hi> of that <hi>Religion,</hi> which can alone be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by him who drew the World out of Nothing.) two remarkable Stroaks of this <hi>French Tiberius,</hi> which I have learn'd but lately.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſent to <hi>Madrid, incognito,</hi> a <hi>General</hi> of certain <hi>Derviſes;</hi> a Man of a fit <hi>Genius</hi> to ſecond his own, of a piercing and ſubtle Wit, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in <hi>Secular</hi> Affairs; after having given him expreſs Order, that aſſoon as ever he ſhould be in <hi>Spain;</hi> he ſhould do ſuch and ſuch a thing, and, that at his return into <hi>France,</hi> he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into his Hands alone the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of what he had tranſacted. This <hi>Monk</hi> ſucceeded very well in the Employ he undertook; but, in his Return, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſent an expreſs Command to him, to deliver, before he entred into <hi>France,</hi> all his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, into the Hands of a Gentleman who brought him his Letter. This <hi>Dervis</hi> obeyed; but he was diſgraced, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> maintained; 'twas a Crime to obey in this Occaſion; for, having once received an Order to entruſt no body with theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers but himſelf, he could not be excuſed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them to others; and, for this Reaſon, he forbad him to ſet Foot within the Kingdom. This poor <hi>Religious</hi> died ſome time after, deſperate at this Uſage; and perhaps, this is the firſt time a man has been puniſhed, for too punctual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not many Moons, ſince there came Poſt a Perſon of Quality from <hi>Italy,</hi> who brought conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable News to the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> 'Tis impoſſile for me, to expreſs the Careſſes this Favourite made him.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46436:179"/>And, to denote his Joy, he immediately preſented him with a rich Diamond, and made him hope for ſtill greater Recompences; yet, this ſame Perſon that had brought this ſo good News, was carried to the <hi>Baſtile</hi> aſſoon as he came out of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Cloſet, where he remained for ſome Months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing any Body; ſo, that he imagined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all that while in a Dream; but, at length, his Priſon-Doors were ſet open, and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would ſee him, and made him be given as many Hundred Crowns as he had paſt over Days in his Solitude. He accompanied this Preſent he made him, with all the Civilities imaginable, and ſaid theſe Words to him: <hi>Thou art not to blame, and yet I could not but puniſh thee for my Fault, when I made thee enter into my Cloſet aſſoon as thou cameſt from</hi> Italy, <hi>to bring me ſo advantageous News. The great Deſire I had to know the Parriculars of the Buſineſs, made me forget to take off from my Table a Writing of great Importance, which thou mighteſt have read entire; which contained the Revolt of</hi> Catalonia, <hi>the Demands of this</hi> Province, <hi>and the Intrigues of</hi> France, <hi>which cauſed this Inſurrection: And the Knowledge of ſo important a Myſtery, might make my Prince loſe the Acquiſition of ſo Rich a</hi> Province; <hi>ſo that I could not imagine a more ſafe and ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, than to ſhut thee up in a Place, where it was impoſſible for thee to make any uſe of the Notices thou didſt get, by my Imprudence. But, things being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſuch a Condition, wherein 'tis impoſſible</hi> France <hi>ſhould receive any prejudice; I reſtore thee thy Liberty, and entreat thee to forget the Severity which Reaſons of State have put me upon. Receive from my Hands, the Preſent which the King my Maſter makes thee; and be pleaſed to reckon me, amongst the Number of thy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proſtrate my ſelf again at thy Feet, Holy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, intreating thy Benediction, and that thou wilt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:46436:180"/>look on me as one of thy moſt obedient Children; having ſuch a Reſpect to thy <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as is due to the greateſt Miniſter of Heaven, that ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the <hi>Holy Alcoran</hi> in the Empire of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alſo intreat thy Prayers, that <hi>God</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Supplications which thou ſhalt offer him, would give me the Grace to live honeſtly, and ſerve the <hi>Sultan</hi> faithfully, and that I may die in the Religion of my Fathers.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimakam.</head>
                  <p>THE Books of the <hi>Arabian, Geber,</hi> are not to be found in that Language which thou deſireſt them in; I have ſought for them, I believe, in above Two Hundred Bookſellers Shops, and there's not one of them knows, they were ever tranſlated into the <hi>Tongue</hi> in which thou wouldſt have them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis now ſome time ſince theſe Books have been common in <hi>France;</hi> and there are ſeveral perſons who apply themſelves to Dr. <hi>Geber</hi>'s Science; but there's no Tranſlation of them into any of the Common Languages of <hi>Europe.</hi> When I enquired for this Book, the Bookſellers asked me ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Queſtions; and eſpecially, Whether I ſought for Receipts to prolong Life. Some there were, who asked me grinning, Whether my Deſign was to fix ſome volatile Deity; and others anſwered the Queſtion I made them on the Book of the learned <hi>Geber,</hi> only by a Silence, accompanied with
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46436:180"/>ſome Smiles; and at the ſame time putting into my hands a Book, and ſaying to me, <hi>Here's what you look for; This is what you want,</hi> Monſieur Abbot: And this Book treated of Impoſſible Things; Of the <hi>Quadrature of the Circle</hi> in <hi>Geometry,</hi> of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Stone</hi> in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> of the <hi>Perfection of the Orator</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> of a <hi>Republick,</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>Plato</hi> would have in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> and of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perpetual Motion</hi> in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I did not ſeem to be much moved at theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Dealings with me; but, I found a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Capucin,</hi> who put me in hopes of recovering the <hi>Geber</hi> thou ſeekeſt; for, he aſſured me he ſaw it in <hi>Caldee,</hi> or in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Language in a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man's Library, without giving me any Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think it may be purchaſed, becauſe he that poſſeſſes it is not needy of Money.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not perhaps, be diſpleaſed to know what this <hi>Religious</hi> told me concerning <hi>Chymiſtry;</hi> and he appeared to me, not only to have Learning, but Experience. He aſſured me, there were in <hi>Paris</hi> alone, ſeveral Thouſands of Men that applied themſelves to this Exerciſe; and, that there are above Four Thouſand Authors who treat of this Science: that King <hi>Geber</hi> was the moſt knowing and cleareſt in his Expreſſions; and yet there are none but ſuch as are real Philoſophers, and wholly bent to the Study of Nature, that can eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him. Whereunto he added, there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral people who laboured with great Patience, but few with thoſe Qualifications which are neceſſary to find Succeſs: He affirm'd, that <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is fruitleſs; that one muſt have a long Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and continual Exerciſe; that moſt People labour to no purpoſe, becauſe they do not take Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their guide, no more than the Operations ſhe makes in Minerals; becauſe, according to <hi>Geber,</hi> the Principles of the Art, ſhould be thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46436:181"/>it ſelf; and that it is only in Metals, we can find Metals, and that it is, in fine, by Metals one can ſucceed in the making of perfect Metals.</p>
                  <p>This good <hi>Dervis</hi> maintained, That the true way to proceed to the Perfection of this great Work, conſiſts in the Union of the Mineral-Spirits purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art, with the perfect Metallick Bodies, having firſt volatilized them, and then fixed them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the Radical Humidity, and in augmenting the Natural Heat, by a diſcreet Coction of the Compoſition; which comes by this marvellous Ferment, which makes all this Maſs boyl, and puts it into a Fermentation: So that this marvellous Compoſition, inſinuating it ſelf by Penetration into the moſt ſubtle parts of the melted Mettal, by the external Fire, and radically diſſolving it, it ripens it, and purges it from whatever is not of the Eſſence of Gold, and of Mercury, till the whole be driven out to an entire Perfection: Which made the Maſter of Maſters; the Learned <hi>Geber</hi> ſay, That this perfect <hi>Elixir</hi> being the pure Subſtance of Metals, it ſeeks in the melted Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals that which is of the ſame Nature with it ſelf and perfects it.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it is impoſſible for the Artiſt to produce any thing that is new according to his Fancy, but only to joyn or ſeparate what Nature has produced; <hi>Raymond Lully</hi> would have us underſtand, that the Body in this Art is the Mettallick Being, in which lies the Mineral Spirit, becauſe the Metals are nothing elſe but this Spirit, of which conſiſts the <hi>Philoſophers Stone;</hi> and this Spirit is properly the Vertue of Minerals, in which is contained the Spring of Metals. But the famous <hi>Geber</hi> has clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, that this Stone is wholly created and formed by Nature, to which the Artiſt neither adds or diminiſhes any thing, but only makes it change its place by his Preparation, which in every other reſpect is uſeleſs.</p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:46436:181"/>
                  <p>This <hi>Fryar</hi> affirms, This Mineral Body, entirely Spirituous as it is, has yet four ſorts of Superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which it muſt be purged by the Hand of the Artiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a great Humidity, the Earth which is found therein; the ordinary, Sulphur which burns, and the Salt which is corroſive: and it muſt be purified by Calcination, Diſſolution, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation, and Fixation, that there may alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the Radical Humidity fix'd and permanent; which being afterwards united in a indiſſolvible manner to the perfect Body, compoſes this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Body, which is ſo much ſought and ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found, and which is an hot <hi>Elixir,</hi> powerful to ripen and purifie all imperfect Metals, and convert them into Gold or Silver.</p>
                  <p>There is afterwards given an Activity to the Gold, in refining it by new Degrees of Fire, added to that which it already had.</p>
                  <p>Thus far went our Converſation, when an old Woman came unhappily upon us, and bereaved me of the Satisfaction of learning of this <hi>Religious,</hi> ſome important Secret which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he ſeemed inclinable to entruſt me with. This indiſcreet and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Woman, uſing the Liberty ordinary with the People of this Country, cruelly interrupted our Converſation; and I remained ſtruck, as it were, with a Flaſh of Lightning, when this knowing <hi>Fryar</hi> told me, That the Arrival of this Woman forced him to take his leave of me; and he prepared to be gone, like a man that was expected for ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affair; when caſting his Eyes on my Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he perceived the Perplexity and Confuſion which this Separation cauſed in me; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, he ſaid thus in my Ear: <hi>I know very well, Friend, thou haſt an inquiſitive Soul, and deſigneſt great things; meet me at my Cell, and in the mean time, I'll tell thee, for thy Conſolation, in plain Terms, That it has always been, and ever ſhall
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46436:182"/>be my Opinion, that to labour profitably, one muſt follow</hi> Raymund Lully's <hi>Rules. This great</hi> Philoſopher <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and I am of his Mind, That to make Gold, one muſt have Gold and Mercury, and Mercury and Silver to make Silver; but, I underſtand by Mercury, that Mineral Spirit ſo refined and purified, that it aurifies the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y Seed of Gold, and argentiſes that of Silver.</hi> Theſe are the very Words he ſpake to me.</p>
                  <p>But, in leaving me, I entreated him to tell me, Whether it was eaſie to attain to the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great Work, and what was neceſſary for that great End.</p>
                  <p>He anſwered me, 'Twas very hard, which made almoſt all People deſpair of compaſſing it; there being very few People, on whom Heaven beſtowed the neceſſary Qualifications to acquire this precious Art; that theſe Qualifications conſiſted in being a true <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and in being perfectly skilled in <hi>Naure,</hi> in having a Patience Proof againſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments; and, that a Man ſhould be in the Flower of his Age, ſtrong, and vigorous, to endure Labour, well furniſh'd with Wealth, and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable. Whereunto he added, That if any of theſe Qualities were wanting, one might be certain, that the others would be ſo alſo; That a Man who is unacquainted with <hi>Nature,</hi> works lik a blind Man; And, that ſhould one fail of Succeſs, the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, fourth, nay, fifth, or ſixth time in the Operation, he is a Fool that then grows wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and does not again begin to ſet at work, with the ſame Earneſtneſs, and Hopes of Succeſs; and that ſhould a Man want a vigorous Health. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would weaken and make him faint; and that, in fine, if one be without ſufficient Eſtate, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Work ſhould ſucceed; which demands an entire Man, and ſuch a one as minds nothing elſe.</p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:46436:182"/>
                  <p>This <hi>Derviſe</hi> moreover told me, as a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That ſeveral Perſons had attained to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Undertaking; which employs ſo great a Number of <hi>Virtuoſo's,</hi> in all Parts of the World: For, were it not ſo, there would not be that Quantity of Gold there is; for, all that of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> was not ſufficient to ſatisfie ſo many People, who mind nothing elſe but gaining of it; and that, in fine, ſuch great Treaſures which are heap'd up, and the Gold that runs in Traffick, never came out of the Mines which are in the Mountains, but that a great part has been made by Artiſts. He moreover aſſured me, That the Overſeers of the <hi>Mint</hi> in <hi>France</hi> affirmed, as a thing beyond all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, That there was more Gold brought to them, than ever came from Foreign Parts; which made him conclude, that the Art is true, and that no man need doubt that there is ſuch a thing as the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Converſation, although interrupted, made me ceaſe being incredulous; and if I were an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> in this Matter yeſterday, I begin now to have Faith, and believe, only 'tis a Work extream diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; and I do no longer wonder, there are ſo many People who deceive others, without any Deſign of doing it; and am not ſurprized, they ſhould apply themſelves to all ſorts of Perſons, not excepting Princes: For they believe ſtill, they ſhall meet with Succeſs; and not being able to furniſh the Charges they muſt be at, they uſe all ſorts of Tricks to move thoſe whom Covetouſneſs renders, in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, very eaſie to be perſuaded; and all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral meet in their Operations, with great Hunger, Cold, Lobour, and Smoak.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, as if that which hindred thoſe who have been fortunate enough to attain the Perfection of this Work, from communicating their Knowledge in this Matter, was the dread of their Prince's
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46436:183"/>Power; as having oft experienced, that they are jealous at the Riches of a private Perſon. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns cannot endure, that a mean Wretch, born amongſt the Dregs of the People, ſhould have in his Power wherewithal to make himſelf happy and ſeveral others; which obliges them to deprive theſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of the means of working; and makes them labour in ſecret, and conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with more care, when they have finiſhed their Work. Great Men cannot eaſily ſuffer pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate People to become Maſters, by virtue of this Art, and to do all thoſe Wonders which by this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Metal may be wrought in their Cloſets, without going to <hi>Peru,</hi> and ranſacking there the Bowels of the Earth, They know very well, that this long'd for Gold, produces every thing; gives Reputation; makes them fol'ow one, who fled from a Man before, corrupts thoſe who appear the moſt incorruptible, opens the ſtrongeſt Doors, overthrows whole Armies, cauſes a Man to change his Mind in a moment, makes him that was a poor Man, preſently talk <hi>Sentences.</hi> Nay, many <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> affirm this Metal to be ſo efficacious, that it draws the Souls out of a doleful Abode, call'd <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;</hi> ſo that it ſeems, as if it appeaſed God's Wrath, and brings Men to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Theſe afore-mentioned Reaſons, obliged the cruel <hi>Diocletian</hi> to put to Death as many <hi>Chymiſts</hi> as could be found in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and at the ſame time to cauſe their Books to be burnt, leſt the People, who were naturally ingenious, being become too powerful by the Art of making Gold, ſhould undertake a War againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But we find, in the ancient Writings of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> having learn'd of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, the Art of perfectly knowing Nature, and that of the Converſion of Metals, and making Gold, to write in Letters form'd of this Metal, the Law he preſcribed the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> He
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46436:183"/>taught it to <hi>Carun,</hi> a poor Man, but his intimate Friend, and near Kinſman; who being become very rich by means of this <hi>Science,</hi> had heap'd up immenſe Treaſures, and built himſelf forty houſes, which were filled with Gold, but were all ſwallowed up, and buried in the Earth, by the Virtue of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, with the Maſter of them, whom ſo great Riches had rendred proud, and made him think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf from obeying this great Servant of <hi>God;</hi> having falſly accuſed him before the People of divers Crimes, and eſpecially of having abuſed a Virgin.</p>

                  <p>THE Adventure which thou relatedſt happened in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ſhews, that Women are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to great Accidents. Their Condition is unhappy when they are handſome, but more when they are homely and deformed. The Fathers, Brethren, and Husbands guard the former, as <hi>Cerberus</hi> guarded the Gates of Hell; and the others guard themſelves, and look on all things with Eyes of Envy and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, which makes them empoyſon every thing. But that which happens amongſt us, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what's in <hi>France,</hi> where Women enjoy almoſt a Liberty equal to that of Men. Not but that we ſee notable Adventures happen there; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Queen, who is Mother to a great King now reigning, and yet lives in Exile, and as a Fugitive, amongſt Strangers, through the Credit of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> for whom ſhe has not all the Deference he expected. And an ancient Lady, (I may call her ſo, now ſhe does not hear me,) told me ſuch things ſome days paſt, on this occaſion, which I can ſcarce believe my ſelf, did I not know them to be true from elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>I am farther told, that this <hi>Cardinal,</hi> not having ſucceeded in the deſign he had of marrying his Niece with a Prince of the Bloud, intended (if he could) to marry her to the King's Brother: But there's no great likelihood, but ſo able a Miniſter muſt ſee into the miſchievous Conſequences into which this Promotion would bring him; for, it would undoubtedly draw on him the Hatred of all the great People in the Kingdom. And, I would
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46436:184"/>not be mentioned at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the Author of all the News talk'd of at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'tis certain, this <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſent the <hi>Chancelor,</hi> a venerable Perſon, and by his Office a man of great Authority, to ſeize on this Princeſs's Papers, in hopes he might meet with ſome Letter which might favour that Deſign. The <hi>Chancellor</hi> executed the Order he had received, but found nothing of what the <hi>Cardinal</hi> pretended; ſo that this Perſecution ſerved only to manifeſt this Princeſs's Vertue, who lives in ſuch a manner, as may not only ſerve as an Example to all Queens, but all the Women in the World.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, this ſame <hi>Chancellor</hi> being come to compliment the Queen on the Birth of the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> ſhe told him in a compoſed manner, but very pleaſantly, That this Viſit was very different from that ſhe had received from him about a Year paſt.</p>
                  <p>If Perſons that are ſeated in the higheſt degrees, be not ſecure from the bold Attempts of thoſe who are infinitely below them, and who are born to ſerve them; the beautiful <hi>Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If her Innocency be well proved, ſhe will be the more pleaſing to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and the falſe Accuſation laid againſt her, will be a new Charm to him: whereas, ſhould ſhe be found guilty, we muſt grant ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the moſt dreadful Puniſhments; for having violated, if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf, the Sacred Nights of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the young <hi>Perſian</hi> was found diſguiſed in Woman's Apparel in ſome of the neighbouring Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: And though he, in the midſt of the Torments he ſuffered, died without confeſſing any thing; yet it cannot be ſaid, he died innocent, after ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>I hope thou wilt inform me what has happened ſince thy laſt Letter, and in what manner the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46436:185"/>of this beautiful Slave ſhall be ended. I ſhall be much troubled for her if ſhe be innocent, and cannot be wholly free from Compaſſion for her, if ſhe prove guilty.</p>
                  <p>Leave not off writing to me, and if it be poſſible, be not weary of loving me. I ſpeak in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our <hi>holy Prophet,</hi> I love thee with the ſame Affection as ever, and I dare not utter an Untruth before him.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimakam.</head>
                  <p>TIS about 60 years, ſince <hi>D. Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> died in <hi>Africk,</hi> by the Hands of the <hi>Moors;</hi> and yet his Subjects will believe him ſtill living.</p>
                  <p>He parted from <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the Year 1578. in the Deſign of re-eſtabliſhing on his Throne <hi>Muley Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, Cheriff</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> whom his Uncle <hi>Muley Abde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemelech</hi> would bereave of his Kingdom; but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to endeavour at the making himſelf Maſter of <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Army conſiſted of a Thouſand Sail, well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Proviſions, few Soldiers, but a great many <hi>Nobility.</hi> This Prince was not above 25 years of Age, when he formed this Enterprize; he was a ſtrong bodied Man, of a moderate Stature, but well ſet; his Hair was yellow, his Eyes great, and full of Fire, his Courage was not inferiour to his Strength, and he had no violent Inclination to Pleaſures, which generally take Men's Minds off
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46436:185"/>from gallant Actions; he was temperate in all things; yet very forward in Undertakings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways firm and unmovable in greateſt Dangers. He was a great Husband of his Revenues, employing them in his Subjects Defence, or to the Increaſe of his own Power. He was agreeable to all thoſe that waited on him; and in the freeſt Converſations, he took care not to diſoblige any one by ſharp Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, or diſtaſtful Sayings; and ſo merciful was he, that he avoided all Occaſions of condemning his Subjects to Death. He paſſionately loved War; but 'tis thought, the Expedition into <hi>Africk,</hi> wherein he periſhed, came from <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>D. Sebaſtian</hi> was kill'd in fighting with an Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Courage. The <hi>Moors</hi> ſay, That his Enemies were ſo charmed with his Courage, that his Death drew Tears from their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>He was forſaken by his own; mortally wounded near the right Eye-brow; and pierced with Darts in ſeveral Parts of his Body. He had no Wound in his Head, becauſe he was armed; but he had a great one in his Arm, which ſeemed to come from a Musket-Bullet. 'Tis ſaid, he was buried in the Field, near a <hi>Moor,</hi> without any Ceremony, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Company of his Relations, or Subjects. And, this was the End of this Great King, who made all <hi>Africk</hi> at firſt to tremble.</p>
                  <p>Although the <hi>Moors</hi> rejoyced at the Death of ſo puiſſant an Enemy; that his Friends bewailed his Misfortune: The Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> celebrated his Funeral in a magnificent manner; and, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> proffered ſeveral thouſand Crowns for his Body, to bury him in a manner anſwerable to the Dignity of his Birth and Merit; and that Four Kings have ſince ſupplied his Throne; yet was there found a Man bold enough to maintain in the Face of all <hi>Italy,</hi> that he was really <hi>D. Sebaſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He preſented himſelf at <hi>Venice</hi> in an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46436:186"/>of the wiſeſt Magiſtrates in <hi>Europe;</hi> he reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them the Accidents of his Life; the Hiſtory of his Predeceſſors; the Misfortunes he met with in <hi>Africk,</hi> whence he retired into <hi>Calabria.</hi> He did more; for he ſtripp'd himſelf before this Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſſembly; he ſhewed them Seventeen Marks on his Body, which were acknowledged with Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> themſelves, to be at leaſt very like thoſe which they knew their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign had on his Body; and he alſo ſhewed, that he had one Hand greater than the other, and a Lip diſproportionable in the ſame manner, which were the well-known Marks in the Perſon of <hi>D. Sebaſtian.</hi> He talks of Ambaſſadors, which he ſent to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;</hi> he cites the Anſwers he had received; and all he ſays, is found conformable to the Truth: He anſwers without Heſitation, to all that is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; which makes ſeveral of the <hi>Senate</hi> believe him to be really the King, and others take him for a Witch.</p>
                  <p>But in fine, this Prince, right or wrong, is led away to Priſon at the Solicitation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; where having long lain, he is ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, under an Obligation to leave the <hi>Venetian</hi> Countries in Three Days time.</p>
                  <p>Some <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> moved with Compaſſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed him in a <hi>Derviſe</hi>'s Habit, and conducted him ſecretly to <hi>Florence,</hi> to tranſport him afterwards to <hi>Rome;</hi> but the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> cauſed him to be apprehended, and ſent him to the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi> He preſented himſelf before him with his uſual Confidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſurprized all that ſaw him, and heard him ſpeak; and ſeeing the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he ſaid to him with great Aſſurance, and Gravity, <hi>Be covered,</hi> Count de Lemnos; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged this Miniſter to ask him, <hi>By what Authority he took on him this Boldneſs?</hi> To which, he anſwered, <hi>That his Authority was born with him; and, that he feigned
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46436:186"/>not to know him; and yet he ought to remember, that King</hi> Philip, <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, had ſent him twice to him, and that the Sword which he then wore by his Side, was that which he then gave him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sentence which the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> gave of him, was, That he was an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> who deſerved to be ſent to the Galleys, and ſhould not long be from them; and wherein, 'tis ſaid, he died ſome time after.</p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have been perſuaded, he was their real King; and do ſtill continue of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on, there being nothing which is able to make them change it. Some Perſons in the World will have him to be a <hi>Magician,</hi> others an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and the moſt ignorant will have him to be a <hi>Devil,</hi> or really the <hi>King</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is not the firſt Example of the Boldneſs of an Impoſtor; <hi>Rome</hi> ſaw heretofore a Man, that had the Audaciouſneſs to publiſh he was the real <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> who was killed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Cruelty of the young <hi>Ptolemy.</hi> The Queen <hi>Artemiſa</hi> found one <hi>Artemius,</hi> who had ſo great a Reſemblance with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> her Husband, whom ſhe had cauſed to be murthered, that he was not known, when he put himſelf into the Bed of the dead King, pretending to be this Prince ſick; he recommended <hi>Artemiſa</hi> to his Subjects, and did ſeveral things in favour of this Princeſs. Under the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was there not Occaſion to be ſurprized at the bold An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which a Slave made to this Emperor, who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning him, <hi>How he made himſelf</hi> A grippa? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered without Heſitation; <hi>in the ſame manner thou haſt made thy ſelf</hi> Caeſar.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>D. Sebaſtian</hi> I mentioned, has not been the only one in the World; there have been two others; one of which departing out of the Iſle of <hi>Terceres,</hi> who had great Reſemblance with this Prince, went into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he ſaid he had
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46436:187"/>miraculouſly eſcaped from the Battel he loſt in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick;</hi> that he ſaved himſelf in Woods, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his Kingdom to give Peace to his People, and deliver them from the Tyranny of Strangers; but having been convicted of Impoſture, he was put to Death.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, that another being come diſguiſed in the Habit of a Pilgrim, to <hi>Madrid</hi> it ſelf, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had a long and ſecret Conference with King <hi>Philip</hi> II. (by whom it is ſuſpected he was known for this unhappy Prince,) was, by this King's Order, ſaid to be poyſoned, in a Banquet given him by <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall write ſeveral Things to the Invincible <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir,</hi> of which I deferred to give him Notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would be certain of them, they being of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and it would have been great Lightneſs in me, to have written them on the firſt Reports ſpread amongſt the People.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>'TIs not known, whether it be the Recompence of a good or bad Action, which Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> has ſent with ſo great Secrecy. Thoſe that give an ill Interpretation to the beſt Things, ſay it is not to be ſuppoſed, there could be ſent in a dark Night, a Mule laden with Gold, to an unknown Perſon; but this muſt denote ſomething very extraordinary, and thoſe who pretend to know more than others, are ſometimes more ignorant than thoſe who pretend to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For, who can penetrate into what ſo crafty a Miniſter does, in the moſt retired Places of his Cloſet? His Actions are ſo myſterious, that when he looks towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> his Deſigns lie a direct contrary Way. He deceives thoſe who watch him moſt narrowly. I cannot inform thee then of any thing certain, The Matter is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly related; but thus I think it was: The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> cauſed ſome Days paſt, to be loaded on a Mule, a great Summ of Money; he ordered him to whom he entruſted the Conduct of him, to go into a Wood, at ſuch an Hour; telling him, he ſhould find a Man of ſuch a Stature, ſuch a colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Hair, and in ſuch a Habit, who was to ſay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Words to him; whereupon he was to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Mule with his Lading into his Cuſtody. It is ſaid, this Perſon found the Party deſcribed, who would not receive the Preſent, it being not the full Summ agreed upon; That this being related to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> he ſent the ſame Perſon with the Supplement of what was wanting to the Summ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46436:188"/>the Night following, where the unknown Perſon received the full Payment. If this Story be true, as it is affirm'd here to be, this is an odd kind of Way of making Preſents, or paying Debts.</p>
                  <p>But thou maiſt be aſſured, this is not the firſt time the <hi>Cardinal</hi> has paid his Creditors in this Sort.</p>
                  <p>I have been told for certain, that there being arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> a Stranger ill clad, of ſmall Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and without any Attendance, he made him be paid down immediately upon his Arrival, Six Hundred Thouſand Crowns; without any bodies knowing what became of ſo happy a Creditor, nor from what Merit proceeded ſo high a Recompence; though ſome People affirm, that ſo great a Summ is fallen into the Coffers of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General.</p>
                  <p>Receive charitably, the Marks I give thee of my Obedience, and Deſire, which I have of giving thee Satisfaction; and, entreat our <hi>Great Prophet,</hi> that I may be worthy in the <hi>other World</hi> to kiſs thy Feet, and be acknowledged to be of the number of thoſe, for whom he has written his Holy <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi>

                  <p>I Cannot tell whether thou haſt Knowledge of the Uſe of Defiances, which are made amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when they be diſſatisfied or offended with
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46436:188"/>one another; which they term Acts of Honour, or the Marks of a gallant Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This Cuſtom of Duels, is become ſo common in <hi>Italy,</hi> and eſpecially in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> that the greateſt Affairs, as well as the ſmalleſt, are therein decided by the Sword; and the Gentry affirm this, to be the beſt way of terminating their Diſputes and Quarrels; which belonging onely to them, cannot be referred, nor ſo well determined, by the grave and cool proceedings of <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Invention of deciding theſe Differences by Arms, either with the Sword or Piſtol alone, in a cloſe or open Field, naked in their Shirts, ſo that one has no Treachery to fear; is a Way of drawing Satisfaction for the Injuries received, found out by Men of great Courage, who more eſteem their Honour than their Lives. The offended Perſon, ſends a Challenge to him from whom he has received the Injury; this note of Defiance, is expreſs'd in choice and elegant Words, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and preſs the Offender to fight, in ſuch a Place, on Horſeback or on Foot, cloathed or in their Shirts, ſingle or attended by an equal Number of Friends, which they call Seconds, with Sword and Dagger, or Sword alone, or piſtol. If the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge be received, he is civilly treated who brings it, and, it may be, has rich Preſents given him. But before they ſight, the Enemies embrace, as if they were reconciled; and then in an Inſtant, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inclinations of their Hatred and Revenge, they would one another, they ſpill each others Blood, and oftentimes their Souls go out furious, through the Wounds they have made.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have the Honour of dying in theſe Combats, do oft refuſe their Lives, which a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy would give them, believing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without Shame, ſhould they receive them from an Enemy.</p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:46436:189"/>
                  <p>But, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as a note of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhe conceives at theſe Combats, ſhuts Heaven's Doors againſt the Souls of thoſe who leave this Life without doing Pennance, denying Burial to thoſe who dye in the Field of Battle; or, yield them onely that, which is granted in ſome Parts of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> to certain Women, who proſtitue themſelves, whoſe Corpſe are thrown a Prey to the Birds of the Field, and other Animals, who live on Carrion.</p>
                  <p>It is not only in <hi>Italy</hi> People kill one another in ſingle Combats; 'tis the ſame in <hi>France,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Nobility,</hi> who manage theſe Combats in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sort. The beſt Friends tear one another on the ſmalleſt occaſion, and they prepare for a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in ſuch a manner, as will appear to thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Enemies ſup together the Night before the Combat, and often lie together in the ſame Bed. The Friends which ſerve as Seconds, do the ſame; and when they are come to the Place where they be to fight, a Friend is forced by the Maxims of Honour, to cut his own Throat, with the Man's he perhaps moſt loves. Nothing happens more frequently in <hi>Paris,</hi> than theſe Kind of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats; and, they produce ſeveral Adventures, of which I would give thee an Account, had I not a particular Story to tell thee on this Subject. It is of a Challenge of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prince, ſent to a King, whoſe Crown could not exempt him from a Letter of Defiance.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt without doubt heard of what has hapned in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where <hi>D. John de Braganza</hi> has been elected and proclaimed King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as the true Heir of the <hi>Royal</hi> Race. Thou knoweſt alſo, he drove the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of his Kingdom, The Duke of <hi>Medina Sedonia,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and this new King's Brother-in-law could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46436:189"/>himſelf from being ſuſpected, of having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand aſſiſted this Prince to aſcend the Throne; whether it be true, or an Artifice of his Enemies, God onely knows: But however it's certain, that the Count Duke <hi>d' Olivarez,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s chief Miniſter, ſent an order to him to appear at <hi>Court,</hi> to juſtifie himſelf from this Suſpicion; he thought to clear himſelf perfectly from the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, by ſending a Challenge to <hi>D. John</hi> of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to oblige him to fight with him; which Letter of Defiance was conceived in theſe Terms:</p>
                  <p>D. Gaſpar Alonzo Peres Guſman the Good, <hi>Duke of the Town of</hi> Medina Sedonia, <hi>Marquis, Count, and Lord of the Town of</hi> St. Lucar <hi>of</hi> Barameda, <hi>Captain General of the Ocean, and Gentleman of his</hi> Catholick <hi>Majeſty's Chamber. I ſay, that</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Braganza, <hi>who was never but a Duke, calls himſelf King of</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal; <hi>that his Treaſon, known to all the World, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, and in Abomination, for having thrown a Stain on the Faithful Houſe of</hi> Guſman, <hi>which has never failed in any Duty to her Soveraign; and, for this reaſon defie, and challenge to a ſingle Combate Body to Body, with Seconds or without Seconds, this</hi> Don John, <hi>heretofore Duke of</hi> Braganza, <hi>leaving all this to his Choice, as alſo the Arms or Weapons and Place of Combat. Written near</hi> Valentia d' Alcanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, <hi>where I ſhall expect fourſcore days News of him, and the laſt twenty Days, I ſhall tranſport my ſelf into the Place he ſhall appoint accompanied, or alone, with ſuch Arms as he ſhall preſcribe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not only the Tyrant of</hi> Portugal <hi>ſhall be advertiſed of my Challenge, but all</hi> Europe, <hi>and the whole World. I pretend to make known in this Combat, the infamous Action of</hi> D. John, <hi>and in Caſe he does not accept of this Defiance, and fails in the Duty of one who is born a Gentleman; I deſire this King, who is only a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm, may periſh in ſome ſort or other: I promiſe to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46436:190"/>give my Town of</hi> St. Lucar, <hi>the principle Seat of the Dukes of</hi> Medina, <hi>to him that ſhall kill him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the mean time, I entreat my Lord the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>to give me no Command in his Armies, but to grant I may onely ſerve him as a Volunteer, with a Thouſand Horſe, which I will maintain at my own Charge, till that ſerving him in this manner, I may help to recover the Kingdom of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and may bring along with me, and caſt at his Majeſty's Fleet, the Duke of</hi> Braganza, <hi>if he will not fight with me in the Manner I propoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou ſheweſt this Letter of Defiance to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> that <hi>Militia</hi> which is terrible to all Nations, whom nothing can reſiſt, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi>'s Orders, they will tell thee what ſuch a Challenge requires from Men of Courage, and explain to thee the Laws which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Valour preſcribe to themſelves: For my part, who am ignorant of the Art of War, and the Maxims of ſuch as make Profeſſion of Arms, I ſhall not make any Judgement hereupon; only take the Liberty to ask of thee, If the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> accepted the Combat, and killed the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> which of the two would have been declared Infamous? Whether there be any Certainty in the Deciſions made by Arms? I am willing to think, Juſtice is on the Side of the Conqueror: But, if on the contrary, the Event of the Duel be uncertain, I take it to be a fooliſh thing for the Duke to expoſe himſelf, and thus Affront the King his Brother-in law. In ſhort, the Duke's Prudence is not to be admired in this Occaſion, and <hi>Braganza</hi> has had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on his Side, ſeeing he has ſhewed by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that he is effectually King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot but call theſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Fools, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch Cuſtoms among them, and yet adore a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is a <hi>God of Peace,</hi> and who calls us <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when they are the only People that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46436:190"/>teach us, and all other Nations, the Arts of ſingle Combats, which is the moſt pernicious Cuſtom that can be introduced amongſt Men, who cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throats oftentimes on ſlight Occaſions, and become Prodigals of that Treaſure with which the Immortal has intruſted them. Neither can I any more approve of Kings and Princes of the ſame Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, making War with one another, as we ſee every Day amongſt thoſe who profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which yet, as far as I can find, ſcarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits any Wars, but ſuch as are Defenſive.</p>
                  <p>Pardon this tedious Letter, excuſe my Conjectures in it, and honour me with thy Commands, which will be reſpected by me as ſo many Obligations.</p>

                  <p>WE hear of nothing now-a-days but Wars and Conſpiracies, Seditions, Treaſons, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelities, and Revolutions of State, and it is in the Kingdoms of <hi>Vice,</hi> wherein theſe Plagues of Heaven make theſe Diſorders, I mean, in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Countries. <hi>Infidelity</hi> reigns amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Catalonia, England</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have hapned in <hi>Barcellona</hi> have no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; the Defiance or the Challenge of a Subject to a King, as is that of the Duke of <hi>Sidonia</hi> to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as his Brother-in-law and his Enemy, does equally ſurprize all the World. We have reaſon to think, that God is angry with the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46436:191"/>
                     <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when we conſider <hi>Flanders, Germany, Italy,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Spain</hi> peſtered with Wars, which they make one againſt another. The Animoſity of moſt of the great People of <hi>France</hi> againſt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> Favourite, enduces them to lay Plots againſt his Life; whence we may ſee, that great Places are good for nothing, but to expoſe men to great Dangers. The laſt Conſpiracy diſcovered againſt the Life of <hi>D. John</hi> IV. of <hi>Portugal,</hi> raiſed to the Throne by the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and betrayed by the ſame <hi>Nobility,</hi> not by the whole Body of them but by a ſmall Number of thoſe who had taken an Oath of Fidelity to him as well as the reſt, does plainly ſhew us, That there is nothing in this World whereon a Man may rely with any Certainty; and that here are many People who undertake juſt Actions, by the Motions of an unjuſt and turbulent Spirit, which cannot ſuffer Things to remain long in a quiet State, and aſpire continually after Change, and to whom every Thing is good, that is new. I ſhall relate to thee, in few Words, this laſt Event. Thou haſt been informed of the others, by the Letters I have written to thee (Invincible <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Ottamon</hi> Armies, and Steward of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Laws, who is the Soveraign of Soveraigns). and by thoſe which the <hi>Kaimacam</hi> and the <hi>Baſſas</hi> have received from me, who are obliged to give thee an Account of whatever comes to their Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Several of the great ones in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and amongſt them, ſome of the new King's Kindred, hatched a Conſpiracy againſt him, and reſolved to put the Kingdom again into the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Hands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruin the Family of <hi>Braganza.</hi> The principal Author of the Conſpiracy, was <hi>D. Sebaſtian de Mattos,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Brague,</hi> the Count Duke <hi>d' Olivarez</hi>'s Creature, to whom he owed his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The chief who conſpired with this Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46436:191"/>Prieſt, were the Marquis <hi>de Ville Reale,</hi> and the Count <hi>d' Armamar;</hi> theſe two Men of great Birth and Credit, ſoon drew ſeveral others into their Party, ſome by the Hope of Recompences, and others through Wearineſs of obeying their new Sovereign, or weary with the new Form of State which they thought might change to their Advantage. They long held a ſecret Intelligence with the <hi>Catholick</hi> King's Council who promiſed them all poſſible Aſſiſtance for the Execution of their Deſign, and after that infinite Recompences.</p>
                  <p>This Conſpiracy was to produce a dreadful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, wherein all the Bloud of the <hi>Royal Houſe</hi> and Family of <hi>Braganza</hi> was to be ſpilt. The King was to be the firſt Victim, with his Children and the Queen his Wife. <hi>D. Duart</hi> alſo was to be put to Death, who was kept cloſe Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Milain.</hi> A Domeſtick, affectioned to his Maſter, and who was attentive to what paſt, delivered the King and Family of <hi>Braganza</hi> out of this Danger. He was ordinarily employed in ſecret Intrigues, and made frequent Courſes into <hi>Spain</hi> to diſcover the Deſigns of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Madrid.</hi> He met by chance in an Inn, a man who ſeemed of a mean Condition, born in the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entered into a ſtrict Friendſhip, as it happens uſually amongſt Travellers, he came to diſcover he was often diſpatched by the <hi>Catholick</hi> King's princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miniſter, on Affairs of great Weight; and that he expected in a ſhort Time to raiſe his Fortune to a conſiderable Pitch, being entruſted with Packets of Letters, containing Things of the higheſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the State. The crafty <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> ſoon diſcerning he might get out Secrets of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment from this imprudent Man, for the good of his Maſter, reſolved to kill him in a deſart Place. where they were to paſs; which he did, having firſt made him drunk with ſtrong Wine. Aſſoon as he had
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46436:192"/>done his Work, he ſtript him, and found Letters and Inſtructions to the Conſpirators, which he ſpeedily carried to <hi>D. John,</hi> who thereby diſcovered the whole Conſpiracy.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, that <hi>D. Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Count <hi>de Vermiſſa</hi> (having been ſolicited by the Achbiſhop of <hi>Brague,</hi> who thought he could eaſily bring him into the Conſpiracy, being diſcontented at the King, for taking away from him a great Office) went to his Soveraign, and freely diſcovered to him the Conſpiracy which had been made, to deprive him both of his Crown and Life: And 'tis added, That this <hi>Count</hi> appeared ſince, one of the hotteſt of the Accomplices, till the very Inſtant wherein they were to execute their Project; at which Time they were apprehended, and puniſhed as they deſerved</p>
                  <p>Others ſay, the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> the King's Brother-in-law, who appeared to the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices to be of the Plot, gave notice of it to the King his Brother. In fine the Conſpirators were executed in ſeveral Places after different Manners, where the People aſſembled, deteſting their Crime, ſhewed great ſatisfaction in their Deaths, and bleſt Heaven for preſerving their Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>They were apprehended one Day, wherein the King declared he would appear in publick; and all the <hi>Nobility</hi> being met, he cauſed the Guilty to be call'd one after another, who were all made Priſoners without any Diſturbance. In the mean time, as many Troops as were near <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Inquiſitor-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> was treated as guilty, for knowing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and not diſcovering it. The <hi>Great Treaſurer Lawrence Pides,</hi> who kept the Keys of the firſt Court of the Palace was to enter in the Night with an hundred men well armed, and begin the Tragedy. The Naval Army which rode at Anchor in the Port
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46436:192"/>of <hi>Beleem,</hi> was to be burnt; and there were them in each Veſſel, who were to ſet them on fire. The four Corners of the City were alſo to be fired; to the end, that the People, the Souldiers, and Guards, of the Palace being buſied in putting it out, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might hinder the Execution of their Deſign; and the good <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> was in the mean time to appear in Publick, bearing about in his Hand what they call the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> crying with a loud Voice, <hi>Let the Law of</hi> Jeſus <hi>flouriſh, and that of</hi> Moſes <hi>die, and come to an End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Marquis <hi>de Ville Reale,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Camine</hi> his Son, near of Kin to the King, have loſt their Heads on a Scaffold, with the Count <hi>d' Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and <hi>D. Auguſtin Manuel;</hi> and the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their Death without any Compaſſion, onely ſhewed ſome Regret at the Loſs of the young Duke of <hi>Camine,</hi> who paſſing before the Body of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all bloudy, threw himſelf on the Ground to kiſs his Feet; asking him a thouſand times Pardon, though he was the Author of this Misfortune. There were others, who ſuffered a more Ignominious Death; who were not only hang'd, but quarter'd, and thoſe Parts of their Bodies ſet up in ſeveral Places for an Example, and to put the people in Mind, that ſuch Attempts ſeldom eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Brague,</hi> and other <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks</hi> his Accomplices; they are kept with great Care in Priſons, in Expectation of Commiſſioners from <hi>Rome,</hi> without which <hi>Prelate's</hi> Conſent, they can do nothing farther to them. The King wore <hi>Mourning</hi> four Hours for the Marquis <hi>de Ville Reale,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Camine</hi> his Son; according to the Cuſtome of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are wont to Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel themſelves in Black for the Death of their Kindred, to denote the Sorrow they conceive at their Loſs; and this Ceremony is term'd <hi>Mourning</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:46436:193"/>which ſometimes laſts a whole Year.

                  <p>An happy Slave will <hi>Mahmut</hi> think himſelf, if he can acceptably ſerve the <hi>Invincible Vizir,</hi> by whom the great Emperor <hi>of the Faithful,</hi> diſcovers his Will to all the People of the Univerſe, whom <hi>God</hi> has created to obey him.</p>
